## Elevator pitch

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that AI-powered "smart readers" represent a significant breakthrough in contract analysis, capable of simplifying, personalizing, and benchmarking terms for consumers. While offering profound benefits like increased understanding, improved market competition, and enhanced access to justice, these tools also introduce serious risks such as errors, bias, adversarial exploitation, and discrimination. Arbel calls for a new legal and regulatory framework to navigate these complex implications, as current doctrines are unprepared for this technological shift and its impact on contract law and consumer protection.
