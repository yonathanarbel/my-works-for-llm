  "abstract": "What does it mean to have machines that can read, explain, and evaluate contracts? Recent advances in machine learning have led to a fundamental breakthrough in machine language models, portending a profound shift in the ability of machines to process text. Such a shift has far-reaching consequences for diverse areas of law, which are predicated on, and justified by, the exis- tence of information barriers. Our object here is to provide a general frame- work for evaluating the legal and policy implications of employing language models as “smart readers”—tools that read, analyze, and assess contracts, dis- closures, and privacy policies. Synthesizing state-of-the-art developments, we identify four core capabili- ties of smart readers. Based on real-world examples produced by new ma- chine-learning models, we demonstrate that smart readers can: simplify complex legal language; personalize the contractual presentation to the user’s specific sociocultural identity; interpret the meaning of contractual terms; and benchmark and rank contracts based on their quality. Nevertheless, the implications of smart readers are more complex than initially meets the eye. Although smart readers can overcome traditional infor-",
