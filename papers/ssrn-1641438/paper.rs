## TL;DR
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that specific performance in contract law is often less effective and less frequently sought than theories suggest. His qualitative study in Israel reveals parties avoid it due to enforceability issues, lawyer agency problems, and changing preferences. When pursued, motivations include signaling or post-judgment renegotiation. Findings show practical enforcement difficulties, especially for unique goods, and challenge assumptions in both rights-based and economic theories, highlighting a gap between legal doctrine and real-world litigant behavior and outcomes, necessitating a re-evaluation of its role and efficacy.

## Section Summaries
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that parties often avoid suing for specific performance due to low enforceability, lawyer agency issues, and evolving preferences. When they do seek it, their reasons can extend beyond simply wanting performance, including signaling case strength, aiming for quicker and less costly resolutions, or strategically positioning themselves for post-judgment renegotiation.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his qualitative study shows many plaintiffs choose damages over specific performance due to its difficult execution, especially for unique goods with unclear standards, and sometimes because lawyers prefer damages for easier fee collection. He notes these practices often contradict established theories, as plaintiffs may resist commodifying judgments (challenging economic views) or use the remedy instrumentally for non-performance goals (challenging rights-based views).

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contract law features a core debate between economic analysis, focused on efficiency and welfare, and rights-based theories, centered on morality. These perspectives justify remedies differently: rights-based theories often favor specific performance to uphold promises, while economic theories see remedies instrumentally. He notes both frequently neglect the impact of a victim’s choice among available remedies.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that despite growing empirical work on contract remedies, there's a notable gap in understanding parties' internal views, expectations, and behaviors regarding specific performance. His article addresses this through a qualitative study with litigants and lawyers in Israel, chosen for its legal similarity to the U.S. but with specific performance as the default remedy, offering a unique comparative context.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that enforcing specific performance awards presents significant practical issues, especially for unique goods where quality assurance is difficult without defendant cooperation. Surprisingly, parties often avoid post-judgment renegotiation despite financial incentives, due to animosity and cognitive biases. He notes that many plaintiffs prefer damages over specific performance, contrary to theory, challenging traditional assumptions about remedy choice and post-judgment actions.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Aabama School of Law writes that corrective justice theories need to recognize that specific performance can be under-compensatory, a problem not fixed merely by allowing promisees to choose their remedy. He argues that the legal practice of restricting specific performance to unique goods is flawed, as these are often the situations where its enforcement is most problematic and least effective.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his article examines theoretical literature on contract remedies, highlighting assumptions for later empirical testing, and categorizes this literature into rights-based and economic theories. He explains that rights-based theories, a prominent viewpoint, typically assess the morality of actions based on adherence to pre-existing moral principles, rather than focusing on the consequences of those actions.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contract law faces two major challenges: justifying promise enforcement when promisors resist, and deriving legal remedies from moral principles. He notes various theories attempt to address these, citing Charles Fried's duty to keep promises, Randy Barnett's consent theory, Thomas Scanlon's expectation theory, and Seana Shiffrin's virtue ethics approach as examples.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that unlike U.S. law's preference for expectation damages, most contract theorists advocate for specific performance as morally superior, arguing a promise to do X entails a duty to perform X. He identifies a common assumption in many rights-based theories: that a specific performance judgment equates to the actual, timely fulfillment of the contractual promise.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a prevalent view suggests specific performance, despite enforceability issues, better safeguards a promisee's interests than expectation damages, particularly due to challenges in quantifying damages. He also notes a perspective favoring specific performance because it aims to deliver the actual promised performance, rather than being a means to other ends for the promisee.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that economic theories of contract law prioritize the consequences of legal rules, advocating for remedies that maximize parties' joint interests and social welfare. He notes opponents argue specific performance can cause inefficient promisor performance, promisee hold-ups, and wasteful pre-breach precautions by promisors.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that proponents support specific performance as it can secure the promisee's value, bypass costly damage calculations, and promote breach only when truly efficient, assuming parties will renegotiate inefficient awards. He notes a key economic theory assumption: parties will usually renegotiate specific performance for payment if performance is inefficient, given typically low transaction costs.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contract remedy discussions often assume parties will try to renegotiate after a breach, with the new agreement's value meeting or exceeding the original performance value for the promisee. He notes that while remedy efficiency is widely discussed, less attention is paid to how letting promisees choose remedies influences strategic behavior in plaintiff-attorney or plaintiff-court dynamics.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that common law traditionally treats specific performance as exceptional, granted only if damages are inadequate and subject to limitations like hardship or court supervision. His study, influenced by prior research, examines Israel due to its legal system's similarity to U.S. law, but with specific performance as the preferred remedy, contrasting with the common law standard.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Israeli contract law, a mix of statutory and common law with U.S. influence, designates specific performance as the default and morally superior remedy, often called "the first and foremost." He explains that enforcement can involve contempt petitions, with courts having wide discretion to impose financial or criminal sanctions for compliance.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while Israeli and American contract law structures are similar, they differ on remedy prominence, with Israeli law clearly making specific performance the default. His empirical research is an exploratory qualitative study using interviews with Israeli stakeholders, designed to understand the law's real-world application due to a lack of prior empirical studies.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his contract remedies study used "maximum variation" sampling as a random representative sample was impractical; thus, results offer insights into diverse groups but not the frequency of observed phenomena. The 18 participants, selected from a commercial database, comprised six private litigants, eleven lawyers, and one magistrate judge involved in specific performance cases.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his research, using semi-structured interviews with twelve lawyers on specific performance cases, seeks to identify phenomena and report generally applicable findings, not statistical distributions. Preliminary results indicate plaintiffs often avoid specific performance due to enforceability concerns, lawyer preference for damages, or changing client needs. When sought, motivations can include strategic signaling or gaining leverage, not just obtaining the item.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contrary to conventional wisdom favoring specific performance, his early research showed parties often avoid it, with it being sought in less than a third of sampled litigated cases. Interviews with lawyers, aimed at understanding a wider range of cases including settlements, revealed they often counsel clients to choose expectation damages instead.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that specific performance is rarely pursued, despite theoretical preference, due to low enforceability; enforcement hurdles create risk and may result in a lower renegotiated value than damages. Another key factor is lawyers' agency problems, where fee structures can bias attorneys towards money damages, potentially misguiding clients away from specific performance even if it's in their best interest.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that attorneys might guide clients from specific performance due to uncompensated work under contingency fees and fee collection issues; damages offer liquidity and allow lawyers to secure fees via a mechanic's lien. Additionally, evolving client preferences concerning performance or the opposing party relationship during litigation can diminish specific performance's appeal.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that shifts in plaintiff preferences or deteriorating party relationships during litigation can lessen specific performance's practical worth, despite high financial value. He notes parties seek specific performance not just for actual performance but also for strategic aims like signaling case strength, reducing procedural expenses, and obtaining leverage for post-judgment renegotiations.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a plaintiff selecting specific performance over damages can powerfully signal their sincerity and case strength to the court. He adds that seeking specific performance can result in quicker and more economical case resolution than pursuing damages, mainly by sidestepping the complicated and costly task of quantifying financial losses.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that plaintiffs might choose specific performance to cut litigation costs and speed up resolution, even if planning to renegotiate later, particularly if parties can better quantify damages than the court. His research interviews showed that the possibility of post-judgment renegotiation—selling adjudicated rights—sometimes motivates parties to seek specific performance, aligning with economic theory.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his research indicates post-judgment renegotiation (PJR) happens in specific performance cases, with some successful instances, though not all parties pursue it. He notes that PJR failures, despite economic incentives, are often due to psychological obstacles like animosity and mistrust developed during litigation between the parties.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that in specific performance cases, party animosity has mixed effects on settlement willingness: it can obstruct agreement via mistrust or drive successful negotiation to end interaction, yet sometimes causes reluctance despite beneficial settlement. He notes the endowment effect is significant, as litigants awarded a specific good/service may feel strong ownership, making them less willing to renegotiate the judgment.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that parties frequently display an "incommensurability bias," resisting the reduction of judgments to monetary terms and assigning symbolic importance to specific performance, seeing it as distinct from damages. He found individual plaintiffs desired the specific good and were reluctant to monetize their entitlement, whereas lawyers for large firms reported corporate clients easily converted judgments to monetary value.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a surprising scarcity of systematic research exists on post-judgment outcomes of specific performance, fostering a common belief that they lead to promised performance with minimal issues. He notes legal frameworks like the UCC support specific performance's compensatory advantage, reserving it for unique goods where monetary damages are deemed insufficient.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that implementing specific performance decrees is frequently problematic, causing many legal interviewees to see the remedy negatively and potentially under-compensatory. He notes factors like increased performance costs and post-litigation animosity can reduce its value, which, unlike expectation damages assuming full completion, should be weighed against potentially subpar ordinary contract execution realities.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contrary to assumptions that animosity undermines specific performance, case findings suggest its practical impact might be overstated, with some parties maintaining good relations post-judgment. Evidence from finance agreements and a custom door dispute indicates that factors ensuring normal contractual performance can remain effective even after a specific performance decree.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that specific performance can be effectively enforced with clear standards, like custom doors with detailed specs, but fails when monitoring is hard and standards are lacking. He notes the irony that a good's uniqueness, justifying specific performance, can hinder its effectiveness if quality evaluation becomes difficult, potentially under-compensating the promisee.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that appointing a receiver over a promisor's business, though costly (with the defendant paying the receiver's salary), can be a useful enforcement method needing more analysis. He notes plaintiffs face substantial, often higher, post-judgment enforcement costs for specific performance than for damages, and their active involvement is vital for actual performance.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that specific performance's theoretical edge over damages against judgment-proof defendants is reduced in practice because contempt enforcement often uses financial sanctions, ineffective against low-capitalization defendants. However, he notes a defendant's reputational capital can be leveraged for enforcement, especially when financial sanctions are weak due to low capitalization.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a debtor's strong reputation, highlighted by interviewed lawyers and prior research, greatly helps enforce court judgments, even if it didn't prevent the initial breach. He describes reputation as a complex mechanism for securing compliance and notes that social norms and their resulting pressures are another key, context-dependent leverage for enforcement.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that social pressures affect contract implementation complexly and sometimes contradictorily; thus, social norms, though valuable, shouldn't be blindly trusted for enforcement, citing an example of shifting individual resolve. His findings on specific performance litigation impact contract theories, including rights-based ones, which, despite a-priori origins, appear to consider practical consequences of rules, focusing on autonomy over pure economic welfare.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his study shows plaintiffs often use specific performance instrumentally for strategic benefits like hold-up or quicker, cheaper resolution, not just due to broken promises, challenging rights-based theories. He argues common deontological justifications dismissing such uses as immoral or marginal are insufficient, as legal rights address potential moral failures, and his study finds these instrumental uses frequent.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that specific performance frequently isn't truly compensatory and can be under-compensatory compared to damages due to costly enforcement, promisor resistance, and promisee liquidity. Consequently, while remedy choice or combining specific performance with damages might better protect promisees, these methods have limitations and strategic issues, requiring re-evaluation of theories favoring specific performance as superior or sole.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that rights-based theories need modification to account for the disparity between the legal right to specific performance and its real-world outcomes, which can have unintended moral and economic consequences. He argues economic theories must reassess specific performance's assumed high value, as empirical data shows weak enforcement often yields neither performance nor better compensation than damages.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that specific performance decrees might inadequately deter inefficient breaches and be under-compensatory, questioning their effectiveness compared to damages in prevention or compensation. He notes specific performance can be "stickier" than theorized due to negotiation reluctance from factors like commensurability bias, potentially causing inefficiencies and warranting more judicial caution or greater reliance on expectation damages.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a key legal implication of his research is empirically showing significant weaknesses in enforcing specific performance. Enhancing effectiveness is hard without problematic criminal sanctions or by using more liberal financial sanctions and receivership. This raises policy concerns about when specific performance should be available, questioning its use for unique goods where enforcement is acutely difficult.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the assumed adequacy of specific performance for unique goods is undermined by quality assessment difficulties and limited impact against insolvency, necessitating judicial comparative remedy assessment. To improve outcomes, he suggests judges could permit deficiency judgments, create venues for substandard performance, use discretion in awarding remedies instead of deferring to plaintiffs, and consider resolution time impacts.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that interim remedies' potential to alleviate problems needs more study, and ethical rules should tackle lawyer agency problems where self-interest in remuneration influences remedy advice. His qualitative study, viewing contractual practices internally, reveals greater complexity than theories suggest, highlighting the need for more empirical data to refine legal theories on specific performance.

### Page 2
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his qualitative study reveals many plaintiffs opt out of specific performance because it is more difficult to execute than a money judgment, particularly for unique goods where performance standards are unclear, and sometimes due to lawyers advising clients to sue for damages to facilitate easier collection of their own fees.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his findings also indicate parties' approaches to specific performance often contradict established theories, such as when plaintiffs resist commodifying a judgment, which challenges economic theories, or when they use the remedy instrumentally for purposes other than achieving contractual performance, which is in tension with rights-based theories.

### Page 3
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a fundamental debate in contract law exists between normative economic analysis, which emphasizes efficiency and social welfare, and rights-based theories, which are more concerned with the morality of actions and intentions.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that these contrasting theories offer different justifications for legal remedies, such as rights-based theories favoring specific performance for ensuring promises are kept, while economic theories view remedies instrumentally, and both often overlook the implications of a victim's choice between available remedies.

### Page 4
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that there is a significant lack of understanding regarding parties' internal perspectives, expectations, and actual behaviors concerning the legal remedy of specific performance, despite a growing empirical literature on contract remedies. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his article aims to address this gap through a qualitative investigation, involving interviews with litigants and lawyers in Israel, a jurisdiction chosen because its contract law is similar to American law but sets specific performance as the default remedy.

### Page 5
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the enforcement of specific performance awards is rife with practical problems, particularly for unique goods where quality is hard to ensure without the defendant's goodwill, and that surprisingly, parties often refrain from post-judgment renegotiation of these decrees despite financial incentives due to litigation animosity and cognitive perceptions.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contrary to theoretical expectations, many plaintiffs choose money damages over specific performance, and these findings collectively challenge traditional contract theory assumptions about remedy selection and post-judgment conduct.

### Page 6
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that corrective justice theories must acknowledge the under-compensatory reality of specific performance, an issue not resolved simply by granting promisees a choice between remedies.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the legal practice of limiting specific performance to unique goods is misguided, as these are precisely the scenarios where enforcement is often least effective.

### Page 7
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his article reviews theoretical literature on contract remedies, focusing on assumptions to be empirically examined later, and conventionally divides this literature into rights-based and economic theories.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that rights-based theories, a common and influential perspective, generally judge the morality of choices and actions based on adherence to a-priori moral principles rather than on their consequences.

### Page 8
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contract law grapples with two complex challenges: justifying the enforcement of promises that promisors no longer wish to honor, and deriving specific legal remedies from core moral principles.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that various theories have been developed to address these issues, including Charles Fried's concept of a duty to keep promises, Randy Barnett's consent theory, Thomas Scanlon's expectation theory, and Seana Shiffrin's virtue ethics approach.

### Page 9
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that most contract theorists, unlike American law which defaults to expectation damages, argue for specific performance as the morally preferred remedy because a promise to do X implies a duty to actually do X.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a common assumption he identifies in many rights-based contract theories is the treatment of specific performance judgments as a shorthand for the actual, timely performance of the contractual obligation.

### Page 10
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a common view is that specific performance, even accounting for enforceability problems, better protects a promisee's interests than expectation damages, especially given difficulties in quantifying the latter.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a third view favors specific performance for awarding the promisee exactly what they expected to receive—performance itself—rather than the judgment being used for other ends.

### Page 11
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that economic theories of contract law focus on the consequences of legal rules, suggesting remedies should be chosen to maximize the parties' joint interests at the time of contracting based on their effect on overall social welfare. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that opponents argue specific performance can lead to inefficient performance by promisors, potential hold-up scenarios by promisees, and wasteful ex-ante measures by promisors to avoid breach.

### Page 12
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that proponents advocate for specific performance because it can capture the promisee's value, avoid costly damage quantification, and encourage breach only when clearly efficient, with the expectation that parties will trade the award if performance proves inefficient.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a common assumption in economic theory is that parties will generally engage in post-judgment renegotiation, trading the right to specific performance for payment if performance is inefficient, facilitated by typically low transaction costs in contractual settings.

### Page 13
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that common assumptions in contract remedy discourse include the expectation that parties will attempt renegotiation after a breach, and that the renegotiated agreement's value will generally equal or surpass the original performance value to the promisee.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while much attention is given to the efficiency of various remedies, there is significantly less consideration of how allowing promisees to choose their remedies might affect strategic behavior in plaintiff-attorney or plaintiff-court interactions.

### Page 14
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that in common law, specific performance is traditionally an exceptional remedy, awarded only when monetary damages are inadequate and even then, subject to further limitations such as disproportionate hardship or court supervision.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his study, prompted by earlier scholarship, investigates Israel because its legal system, while similar enough to U.S. contract law for comparison, uniquely features specific performance as the preferred remedy, unlike the common law approach.

### Page 15
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Israeli contract law, an amalgam of statutory legislation and common law influenced by American jurisprudence, establishes specific performance as the default and morally superior remedy for breach, often referred to as "the first and foremost" among all other remedies. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that to enforce specific performance, an aggrieved party can pursue options such as filing a petition for an order of contempt, where courts have broad discretion to impose financial or criminal sanctions to achieve compliance.

### Page 16
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while the general structure of Israeli contract law exhibits strong resemblances to American law, the two systems diverge on the prominence of remedies, with Israeli law unambiguously setting specific performance as the default. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his empirical investigation into this matter is an exploratory qualitative study involving interviews with relevant stakeholders in Israel, chosen to capture the law-as-it-is-experienced given the absence of previous empirical work on this issue.

### Page 17
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his study on contract remedies employed a “maximum variation” sampling approach because acquiring a random statistically representative sample was unfeasible, meaning the results provide insight into different groups but are not representative of the frequency of the phenomena described.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the 18 participants chosen for the research, from cases reported to a commercial database, included six private parties involved in specific performance litigation, eleven lawyers, and one magistrate judge.

### Page 18
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his research, based on semi-structured interviews with twelve lawyers about their experiences in specific performance cases, aims to identify the existence of certain phenomena and report findings believed to be of general application, rather than to represent the statistical distribution of all such cases.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that preliminary findings from these interviews suggest plaintiffs often opt-out of specific performance—contrary to its theoretical higher value—due to concerns about enforceability, attorney preference for money damages, or evolving client needs during litigation, and even when seeking specific performance, motivations may include strategically signaling case strength or gaining negotiation leverage rather than solely obtaining the contracted item.

### Page 19
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while conventional wisdom suggests plaintiffs would favor suing for specific performance in breach of contract cases, his early research indicated that parties often abstain, with specific performance sought in significantly fewer than one-third of sampled litigated cases. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that interviews with lawyers, conducted to understand the broader population of cases including settlements, further revealed that they frequently advise clients to opt for expectation damages over specific performance.

### Page 20
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that despite theoretical preference, specific performance is infrequently sued due to low enforceability, as impediments to judgment enforcement mean it carries risk and might yield a lower renegotiated value than expectation damages. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that another significant reason for this deviation is a lawyers' agency problem, where attorneys may have a systematic bias towards money damages due to fee structures, potentially steering clients away from specific performance even when it serves the client's best interest.

### Page 21
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that attorneys may steer clients away from specific performance because it involves significant uncompensated work under contingency fees and presents fee collection challenges, unlike damages where liquidity is assured and lawyers can secure fees with a mechanic's lien. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that changing client preferences over the duration of litigation, regarding the actual performance or the relationship with the opposing party, can also make specific performance a less desirable remedy.

### Page 22
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that changes in a plaintiff's preferences or the deterioration of the relationship between parties during litigation can reduce the practical value of specific performance, even if its direct financial value remains high.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that parties sue for specific performance not only for the commonly assumed reason of wanting the actual performance, but also for strategic purposes such as signaling case merit, minimizing procedural costs, and gaining leverage in post-judgment renegotiations.

### Page 23
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a plaintiff's choice of legal remedy, such as opting for specific performance over monetary damages, can significantly signal the perceived sincerity of their motives and the strength of their case to the court.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that pursuing specific performance can lead to a much faster and cheaper case resolution compared to seeking damages, primarily because it avoids the complex and expensive process of quantifying financial losses.

### Page 24
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that plaintiffs may opt for specific performance suits to reduce litigation costs and expedite resolution, even if they anticipate renegotiating the decree later, especially when parties are more adept than the court at quantifying damages.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that interviews conducted for his research revealed that parties are sometimes motivated to seek specific performance by the prospect of post-judgment renegotiation, where they can sell their adjudicated rights, a finding consistent with economic theory.

### Page 25
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his research on contract remedies shows that post-judgment renegotiation (PJR) in specific performance cases does occur, with instances of successful PJR reported, although it is not consistently pursued by all parties. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the failure of PJR in some specific performance cases, despite potential economic benefits, is often linked to psychological barriers such as animosity and mistrust that develop between parties during litigation.

### Page 26
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that in specific performance cases, animosity between parties has conflicting effects on their willingness to negotiate a settlement, as it can both hinder agreement due to mistrust and motivate successful negotiation to avoid prolonged interaction, yet sometimes leads to reluctance even when settlement is beneficial.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the endowment effect is particularly relevant in specific performance contexts, as litigants who receive a court judgment for an actual good or service may develop a strong sense of ownership and entitlement, making them more reluctant to renegotiate that judgment.

### Page 27
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that parties often exhibit an "incommensurability bias," meaning they avoid reducing judgments to mere monetary value and attach symbolic meaning to specific performance, viewing it as qualitatively different from damages.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while individual plaintiffs expressed a desire for the specific good and were hesitant to monetize their contractual entitlement, lawyers for large firms indicated their corporate clients readily reduced judgments to their monetary value.

### Page 28
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that there is a surprising lack of systematic research on what actually happens after specific performance judgments are entered, leading to a common impression that they simply result in the originally promised performance with few implementation issues.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that legal frameworks, such as the Uniform Commercial Code, endorse the view that specific performance offers a comparative advantage in compensation, reserving it for cases like unique goods where monetary damages are considered inadequate.

### Page 29
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the practical implementation of specific performance decrees is often fraught with difficulties, leading many legal interviewees to view this remedy negatively and find it potentially under-compensatory for the promisee.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that factors such as increased performance costs and post-litigation animosity can diminish the value of specific performance, which, unlike expectation damages that assume full completion, should be assessed against the reality of potentially sub-par ordinary contract execution.

### Page 30
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that despite common assumptions that animosity would undermine specific performance, case findings suggest that its practical importance may be exaggerated, with some parties reporting excellent relationships and cooperation even after a judgment.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that evidence from cases, such as a finance agreement and a consumer dispute over a custom door, indicates that the same underlying drivers that ensure contractual performance in ordinary circumstances can continue to operate effectively even after specific performance has been judicially decreed.

### Page 31
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while specific performance can be effectively enforced by verifying a finished product against clear standards, as demonstrated in a case involving custom doors with detailed specifications, this approach falters when performance is difficult to monitor and quality standards are absent. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the very uniqueness of a good, which initially justifies specific performance, can paradoxically undermine the remedy's effectiveness if it makes quality evaluation difficult, potentially leaving the wronged party under-compensated.

### Page 32
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that appointing a receiver over a promisor's business can be a useful, albeit costly, method to enforce performance, with the defendant bearing the receiver's salary, though further analysis is needed. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that plaintiffs bear significant post-judgment costs for enforcement, which are often higher for specific performance than damages, and in practice, their active approach is crucial for the judgment to be performed.

### Page 33
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the theoretical advantage of specific performance over expectation damages for judgment-proof defendants is diminished in practice, as enforcement via contempt of court often relies on financial sanctions which are ineffective against those with low capitalization, thus limiting its added value.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a defendant's reputational capital can, however, be leveraged to enforce specific performance judgments, which is particularly useful when financial sanctions are unlikely to be effective due to a defendant's low capitalization.

### Page 34
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a debtor's strong reputation, as emphasized by interviewed lawyers and supported by previous research, significantly aids in enforcing court judgments even if it did not prevent the initial contractual breach.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that reputation is a complex and nuanced mechanism in securing obedience to court orders, and that social norms, along with the social pressures they generate, represent another significant, context-dependent source of leverage for ensuring compliance.

### Page 35
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that social pressures can influence contract implementation in complex and sometimes contradictory ways, meaning that while social norms can be valuable, they should not be blindly relied upon to ensure enforcement, as demonstrated by an individual who initially felt shame for breaching a contract but gained strength when others joined his stance. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his findings on specific performance litigation carry implications for contract theories, including rights-based approaches, which, despite being often derived from a-priori principles, seem to consider the consequences of legal rules in practice, albeit by focusing on aspects like autonomy rather than purely economic welfare.

### Page 36
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his study indicates plaintiffs often use specific performance instrumentally for strategic advantages like hold-up or faster, cheaper case resolution, rather than solely due to disappointment from a broken promise, which challenges rights-based theories.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that common deontological justifications for specific performance, which might dismiss these instrumental uses as morally impermissible or marginal, are inadequate because legal rights are established precisely due to potential moral failures, and his study suggests such uses are relatively frequent.

### Page 37
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that specific performance often fails to be truly compensatory, and may even be under-compensatory relative to expectation damages, due to factors like costly enforcement, promisor resistance, and promisee liquidity issues.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that consequently, while a choice of remedy or a combination of specific performance with damages might better protect promisees, these approaches have their own limitations and strategic complexities, necessitating a re-evaluation of theories that advocate for specific performance as a superior or sole remedy.

### Page 38
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that rights-based theories require modification to address the significant gap between the legal right to specific performance and its actual outcomes, which can produce unintended moral and economic effects.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that economic theories, which rely on consequences, must re-evaluate the assumed high value of specific performance due to empirical evidence showing weak enforcement often results in neither actual performance nor superior compensation compared to damages.

### Page 39
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that specific performance decrees may under-deter inefficient breaches and prove under-compensatory, challenging the notion that they are as effective as monetary damages in preventing such breaches or fully compensating promisees.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that specific performance can be "stickier" than theoretically supposed due to an unwillingness to negotiate, driven by factors like commensurability bias, which may lead to inefficiencies and call for greater judicial caution or increased use of expectation damages.

### Page 40
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a primary legal implication from his research is the empirical demonstration of the significant frailty in enforcing specific performance decrees, and that enhancing its effectiveness is challenging without problematic criminal sanctions or by adopting more liberal financial sanctions and receivership. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that consequently, a related legal policy concern arises regarding the circumstances under which specific performance should be available, questioning its current common application to unique subject matter contracts where enforcement difficulties are particularly acute.

### Page 41
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the presumed adequacy of specific performance for unique goods is challenged by difficulties in judging performance quality and its limited effectiveness against a defendant's insolvency, requiring judges to comparatively assess remedies.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that to improve outcomes, judges could allow deficiency judgments, establish venues for addressing sub-standard specific performance, exercise discretion in awarding remedies rather than deferring to plaintiffs, and consider the impact of resolution times.

### Page 42
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the potential of interim remedies to mitigate problems merits further investigation, and that ethical rules should address the agency problem where lawyers might give self-interested advice on remedies due to their own remuneration potential.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his qualitative study, examining contractual practices from litigants' and lawyers' internal viewpoints, shows these practices are more complex than theorized, underscoring the need for more empirical data to refine legal theories and debates, especially concerning specific performance.

ABSTRACT
How is a right to specific performance of a contract used by parties?
Despite longstanding scholarly interest in the topic, this question has been
largely left unexplored. This Article presents a qualitative study of parties and
attorneys involved in specific performance litigation. It investigates how parties
choose between remedies, whether they negotiate after judgment for specific
performance, whether specific performance is implemented, and the difficulties
involved in its implementation.
The findings reveal important theoretical oversights and challenges to
prevailing law. In practice, many plaintiffs opt out of specific performance.
This is puzzling as expectation damages are notoriously under compensatory
relative to performance. A primary explanation is that it is harder to execute
specific relief than a money judgment. Focusing attention on execution
provides a valuable lesson: in exactly these circumstances where U.S. law
grants specific performance—unique goods—it is least valuable due to a lack
of clear standards by which to evaluate performance. Another explanation is
lawyer’s bias: attorneys will often advise clients to sue for money damages to
ensure easy collection of their own fees.
Another set of findings reveal that parties think about specific
performance in ways that are inconsistent with both economic and rights-based
theories. Sometimes plaintiffs will not negotiate a judgment as they will be
reluctant to commodify it, in contrast to economic theories, and other times
they will treat specific performance instrumentally, to achieve other ends but
performance of the contractual promise, which is in tension with rights-based
theories. The Article concludes by discussing the theoretical and policy
implications of these findings, and highlights the ways in which qualitative
research could enrich, challenge, and contextualize contract theory.
I. INTRODUCTION
A central debate in modern contract theory concerns the choice of
remedies for breach of contract—should courts award money damages or
specific relief? This debate is seen as central because it involves some of the

2015] CONTRACT REMEDIES IN ACTION 371
most fundamental dilemmas of contract law:1 whether the law should protect
rights or promote efficiency, bind parties to past commitments or evolve in
light of new information, ensure proper compensation or create optimal
incentives, etc.2
This debate is often understood as being between normative economic
analysis and an assortment of moral philosophies, which can be grouped, for
convenience, under the heading of rights-based theories.3 The economic
analysis stresses efficiency and social welfare, while rights-based theories are
more concerned with the morality of actions and intentions.4 Beyond this
primary normative distinction, these theories base their respective legal
prescriptions on contrasting assumptions about the world in which people
contract: their motivations, understandings, and expectations.5
For concreteness, rights-based theories often favor specific
performance because it is supposed to offer better compensation to victims of
breach than money damages. Additionally, giving the promisee what was
promised in the contract is deemed important, and it is supposed that specific
performance will be used to achieve performance and not instrumentally to
other ends. Economic theories alternatively assume that judgments are used
instrumentally to maximize victim’s welfare rather than coercing performance.
As a corollary, victims will prefer specific performance to expectation
damages, because it can be used either to demand performance or as leverage in
negotiations to extract higher value payment. Lastly, both theories omit from
consideration the choice that victims have between remedies, implicitly
assuming that the choice has no impact on the legal process. If judges, for
example, draw inferences from the choice of remedies on the merit of the case,
or if lawyers are biased in favor of one of these remedies, providing victims a
choice has broader implications than recognized. These assumptions, while not
always explicit, are fundamental to justifying the legal prescriptions that

inter-connections, most scholars adopt a generalized dichotomy between some variant of

follow, and their exploration promises a hope of advancing the debate beyond a
normative stalemate.6
It is therefore disappointing that despite a growing empirical literature
on contract remedies,7 much is still unknown about the empirical validity of
these assumptions.8 An important missing piece of the puzzle is an examination
of the parties’ internal point of view: What are parties’ expectations,
motivations, reasons, and actual behaviors with respect to the legal remedy of
specific performance? How do they put remedies into use, and what is their
practical significance? How do they implement the remedies? The answers to
all of these questions are frustratingly scarce.
This Article makes explicit some of these assumptions and explores
their validity. Its main contribution is a qualitative investigation, consisting of
interviews with litigants and their lawyers who were involved in specific
performance litigation.9
A preliminary design issue is the choice of jurisdiction, because in the
United States specific relief is only awarded in exceptional circumstances. As a
result, the conclusions of any domestic investigation might be limited to these
circumstances rather than the actual nature of specific performance. To
overcome that, what is needed is a jurisdiction where contract law is
sufficiently close to American contract law but nonetheless has specific
performance set as the default remedy. Israel presents exactly such an
opportunity.10
6 Hence, Peter Benson’s pessimistic view that “[t]he effort to develop a coherent
explanation of contract seems to have reached an impasse.” Peter Benson, Contract, in A
COMPANION TO PHILOSOPHY OF LAW AND LEGAL THEORY 29 (Dennis Patterson ed., 2d ed. 2010).

The results are grouped by the chronological stage in the life of a
litigated contract case: choice of remedies, post-judgment renegotiation, and
the implementation and execution of the judgment. Working backwards, the
Article describes, in each stage, findings that challenge traditional assumptions
of contract theory.
Starting with the execution of specific performance awards,
enforcement is found to be rife with practical problems, which are most
pronounced when goods are unique.11 The principal problem is that
performance, unlike damages, often requires the good will of the performing
party—which, by the time the trial is over, is often non-existent and may
actually turn into spite and bad faith. When there are no clear standards by
which to judge the quality of performance, courts lack means of ensuring
quality. When goods are unique, it generally means that clear quality standards
are absent, meaning that in exactly these circumstances where specific
performance is available under American law, it will be hardest to enforce. The
Article also addresses the role of plaintiffs’ and promisors’ liquidity, and
explains that specific performance is not a silver bullet against a promisee’s
insolvency. Social norms and reputation are important leverages, but their
effects are not always in the direction of greater enforcement.
Before the judgment is implemented, economic theory predicts that the
parties will negotiate over the decree if performance is inefficient. A surprising
finding is that some parties (although not all) have refrained from negotiation
despite the existence of an ostensible financial incentive to do so. The
explanation seems to be derived, first, from the litigation dynamics that often
contribute to the animosity between the parties and, second, from the cognitive
perception of specific performance decrees as being qualitatively different from
other goods on the market that may be freely traded. The framing of these
decrees as default rights seems to affect parties’ willingness to negotiate over
them.12
Despite a general theoretical expectation that, given the choice of
remedies, plaintiffs will sue for specific performance, it was found that many
opt-out of the default in favor of money damages.13 Of the reasons identified,
11 See generally Steven Shavell, Specific Performance Versus Damages for Breach of
Contract: An Economic Analysis, 84 TEX. L. REV. 831 (2006).
12 Various lab experiments find that default rules do indeed change parties’ preferences and
therefore may affect the likelihood of settlement. See Russell B. Korobkin, The Status Quo Bias
and Contract Default Rules, 83 CORNELL L. REV. 608, 633–37 (1998); Stewart Schwab, A
Coasean Experiment on Contract Presumptions, 17 J. LEGAL STUD. 237, 237–38 (1988).
13 In economic theory, specific performance is expected to be used as a bargaining chip to
extract side payments from the defendant that exceed the value of expectation damages. See, e.g.,
Marco J. Jimenez, The Value of a Promise: A Utilitarian Approach to Contract Law Remedies,
56 UCLA L. REV. 59, 69 (2008). In deontological theory, the plaintiff motivations are far less
explicit, but it is regularly implied that specific performance will be pursued out of a sense of
vindication of moral rights.

374 WEST VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 118
one that stands out is lawyer’s bias. Attorneys have a general preference for
money damages out of concern for their own fees and their ability to collect
them, which is harder in the case of specific performance decrees.
Of course, not all plaintiffs choose to opt-out. This is predicted by
mainstream theory and may therefore seem to be of lesser interest, but delving
deeper into plaintiffs’ motivations suggests a more involved story. First,
because the plaintiffs are given a choice between different contract remedies,
courts may draw inferences from the choices made and use them to assess the
merits of the case. Lawyers reported that a belief that opting out of specific
performance sends a signal of bad faith to the court, as if the plaintiff is
behaving opportunistically and only cares about money, not performance.
Second, specific performance may be sued for to speed up the resolution of the
case and to reduce the costs of litigation, because the costs of proving damages
are spared. Third, parties occasionally sue for specific performance to use it as
a bargaining chip.14
The Article concludes by discussing various theoretical and legal
implications of these findings. It is argued that rights-based theory should
directly address the instrumental uses that parties make of specific performance
judgments, as they create a wedge between what was promised and what is
legally prescribed. The under-compensatory nature of specific performance
should be recognized within corrective justice theories of contract law, and due
attention should be given to the fact that the problem will not vanish simply by
giving the promisee a choice between damages and enforcement. These
findings suggest new areas for exploration for economic theories—primarily,
the signaling effects of remedies and the attorney’s influence on choice of
remedies. The aversion to post-judgment renegotiation suggests that judgments
are sticky and parties should not be trusted to renegotiate as a general matter.
Concerns with a flood of litigation following a more liberal approach to
specific performance should also be alleviated. Finally, it is explained that
specific performance is not a silver bullet against a promisor’s insolvency.
Regarding the law, it is argued that limiting the scope of specific performance
to cases of unique goods is non-constructive, as these are the cases where
enforcement is most likely to be ineffective. Additionally, it is argued that
lawyers should pay much closer attention to enforcement mechanisms.
The organization of this Article is as follows: Part II lays out the
necessary theoretical framework. Specifically, it points out the relevant
empirical assumptions and the role they play in theory. Part III presents stylized
facts about Israeli and U.S. contract law, emphasizing the similarity of the
systems in the context of this Article. Part IV delves into the methodology and
explains the research protocol. Parts V, VI, and VII discuss the primary
14 While this is exactly what is envisioned by economic theory, it is worth nothing since
other studies have doubted the prevalence of this kind of motive. See Farnsworth, supra note 9, at
391–414 (finding that parties are averse to renegotiate their judgments).

findings of the study. These Parts cover three time periods: the parties’ choices
before and during litigation, the parties’ post-judgment renegotiations, and,
finally, the implementation of the judgment in these cases where no post-
judgment settlement has occurred. The final Part considers the chief theoretical
and legal implications of these findings.
II. CONTRACT REMEDIES IN THEORY: NORMATIVE AND EMPIRICAL
ASSUMPTIONS
This Article responds to the theoretical literature, and a brief review of
this literature is in order. This review will be brief, general, and mostly focused
on those assumptions that will be later examined empirically; the interested
reader may refer to one of the many extensive surveys of the literature
developed elsewhere.15 As is conventional, the discussion is divided into rights-
(and duties-) based theories and economic theories.16
A. Rights-Based Theories
1. Common Structure
Probably the most common and influential perspective on contract
remedies has been that of the rights-based theories. By rights-based theories I
denote a large (and diverse) class of theories, which adhere to non-economic
principles. Generally, these theories judge the morality of choices, actions, or
relationships between individuals based on their adherence to a-priori moral
principles rather than on the basis of their consequences.17 In the contractual
context, the fundamental challenge of these theories is to justify legal
institutions that allow the use of state power to enforce financial obligations
15 See, e.g., Peter Benson, Introduction, in THE THEORY OF CONTRACT LAW (Peter Benson
ed., 2001); Hermalin et al., infra note 42, at 99–127; Paul G. Mahoney, Contract Remedies:
General, in 3 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF LAW AND ECONOMICS § 4600, at 117 (Boudewijn Bouckaert &
Gerrit De Geest eds., 2000) (economic theories); Jeffrey L. Harrison, A Nihilistic View of the
Efficient Breach, 2013 MICH. ST. L. REV. 167.
16 It is worth noting that many non-economic theories also care, at least to an extent, about
consequences. See JOHN RAWLS, A THEORY OF JUSTICE 26 (1971) (“All ethical doctrines worth
our attention take consequences into account in judging rightness. One which did not would
simply be irrational, crazy.”). For a more general discussion, see Christopher P. Taggart,
A Critical Analysis of Kaplow and Shavell’s Project Concerning the Foundations of Normative
Law and Economics 12–14, 73–76 (Nov. 2012) (unpublished S.J.D. dissertation, Harvard Law
School) (on file with the Harvard Law School Library); see also EYAL ZAMIR & BARAK MEDINA,
LAW, ECONOMICS, AND MORALITY (2010) (exploring intermediate positions between
consequentialism and deontology).

which are against the ex-post will of the promisor.18 A second challenge, and
equally complex, is the derivation of specific legal remedies from core moral
principles. 19
Various theories have been developed to address these challenges.20
Famously, Charles Fried has claimed that the justification of legal enforcement
owes to the promisor’s duty to keep his promise, resulting from her willful
solicitation of expectations of performance through the speech act of promise.21
After invoking this trust, breaking the promise is immoral.22 Other important
variants include Randy Barnett’s consent theory, which emphasizes objective
manifestations of assent to enforcement as the basis for the duty to uphold
contracts,23 or Thomas Scanlon’s expectation theory, which is based on the
obligation not to cause harm after invoking expectation of performance by the
act of promise.24 A relatively different theory is Seana Shiffrin’s view, which is
derived from virtue ethics.25 To her, contract law must not create rules that are
18 Duncan Kennedy and Frank Michelman lucidly explain the anti-liberal character of
enforcement “the meaning of enforcement of contracts is the application of ineluctable force to
make people do things they don’t then want to do.” Duncan Kennedy & Frank Michelman, Are
Property and Contract Efficient?, 8 HOFSTRA L. REV. 711, 741 (1980); see also T. M. Scanlon,
Promises and Contracts, in THE THEORY OF CONTRACT LAW 86, 100 (Peter Benson ed., 2001).
The Harm Principle has been interpreted in this context as limiting the use of state enforcement.

Morality: Comments on Charles Fried, 45 SUFFOLK U. L. REV. 719, 726–33 (2011).
19 See generally Richard Craswell, Contract Law, Default Rules, and the Philosophy of
Promising, 88 MICH. L. REV. 489 (1989).
20 For a survey of some of these theories, including the will, bargain, reliance, and fairness,
see Randy E. Barnett, A Consent Theory of Contract, 86 COLUM. L. REV. 269, 271–91 (1986).
21 For an early statement of the idea of promise as a speech act, see J. L. AUSTIN, HOW TO DO
THINGS WITH WORDS 156–57 (J.O. Urmson ed., 1962).
22 See CHARLES FRIED, CONTRACT AS PROMISE 17 (1981) (“There exists a convention that
defines the practice of promising and its entailments. . . . [I]t is wrong to invoke that convention
in order to make a promise, and then break it.”).
23 See Barnett, supra note 20, at 291–319.
24 See Scanlon, supra note 18, at 98–99.
25 See Seana Valentine Shiffrin, The Divergence of Contract and Promise, 120 HARV. L.
REV. 708, 732–33 (2007) [hereinafter Shiffrin, Divergence]. Shiffrin’s view is complicated by the
fact that she distinguishes between moral and legal reasons, with the latter being a sub-set of the
former. Morally, there is an advantage to specific performance over expectation damages, but
legally, she says, “legal” considerations such as the cost of supervision may trump the
desirability of specific performance. See also Seana Shiffrin, Could Breach of Contract Be
Immoral?, 107 MICH. L. REV. 1551, 1568 (2009) [hereinafter Shiffrin, Breach of Contract]
(“There may be distinctively legal reasons to reject [specific performance] given the difficulties
of judicial supervision, risks of arbitrary enforcement, and in some cases, the hazards of
involuntary servitude.”). Overall, I take her approach to be prima facie in favor of the legal
remedy of specific performance subject to circumstantial practical considerations.

2015] CONTRACT REMEDIES IN ACTION 377
incompatible with the moral judgments of a virtuous agent. A law allowing the
promisor a breach option runs afoul of her criteria.26
What should be the legal consequence of a breach of contract? It would
seem that the most natural implication of a promise to do X is a duty to do X
rather than deliver its monetary equivalent.27 And with the notable and widely
criticized exception of Charles Fried,28 most theorists agree that specific
performance is the preferred remedy.29 For these scholars the American law’s
approach of setting expectation damages as the default remedy in most breach
of contract cases is opposed to the dictates of morality, and perhaps even
undermines them.30
2. Common Assumptions
Despite the many differences between the theories, there are a few
assumptions commonly shared that are of interest here, and I will focus on
three. The first concerns the consequences of the specific performance
judgment. Close reading of many of the rights-based theories show that they
will often use specific performance as a shorthand for actual performance of the
contract.31 The difficulty of enforcing either a money judgment or specific
26 All of these views are heavily contested, even within class of rights-based theories, as
documented in Jody S. Kraus, The Correspondence of Contract and Promise, 109 COLUM. L.
REV. 1603 (2009).
27 Jody S. Kraus, A Critique of the Efficient Performance Hypothesis, 116 YALE L.J. POCKET
PART 423 (2007) (“[A] promise to do X imposes on the promisor an obligation to do X and
confers on the promisee a right to have the promisor do X.”). Similarly, Seana Shiffrin contends
that “[a]bsent the consent of the promisee, the moral requirement would not be satisfied if the
promisor merely supplied the financial equivalent of what was promised.” Shiffrin, Divergence,
supra note 25, at 722; see also Stephen A. Smith, Performance, Punishment and the Nature of
Contractual Obligation, 60 MOD. L. REV. 360, 361 (1997) (“The natural way to make good a
failure to do that which one has an obligation to do is to perform the obligatory action”).
28 See FRIED, supra note 22 (arguing for expectation damages), and the intermediate
approach taken by Thomas Scanlon, Promises and Practices, 19 PHIL. & PUB. AFF. 199, 205
(1990) (contending that if compensation and performance are of equal value to the promisee then
moral principles will be neutral between the two). For the critique of this approach, see, for
example, KAPLOW & SHAVELL, supra note 5, at 161 n.18, and Kraus, supra note 26, at 1605.
29 Notable in this regard is Dori Kimel who, while favoring specific performance in
principle, allows promisors a choice between specific performance and damages, in cases where
both are equally compensatory, as a means of minimizing the infringement on the promisor’s
autonomy. See DORI KIMEL, FROM PROMISE TO CONTRACT: TOWARDS A LIBERAL THEORY OF
CONTRACT 95–102 (2003).
30 See Shiffrin, Divergence, supra note 25, at 733 n.47 (arguing that law’s content should
promote a culture that would be acceptable by a morally decent person). See id. for my
interpretation of her argument.
31 See, e.g., SMITH, supra note 1, at 401 (“[W]hile it is true that late performance is not
identical to timely performance, in most cases this difference would seem to relate only to the
form of the obligation rather than its essence.”); Melvin Aron Eisenberg, The Bargain Principle

relief are abstracted at least in the general case, and it is assumed that the
absolute enforceability of both is high.
Second, and more common than the former, is the view that, even if
specific performance is not the same as performance, it will nonetheless better
protect the promisee’s interests than expectation damages.32 That is, even after
accounting for problems of enforceability, specific performance would yield
greater value to the promisee than would expectation damages, especially given
the problems of quantifying the latter. This assumes the relative enforceability
of specific performance to be higher than or equal to that of money judgments.
It implies that generally, promisees would opt for specific performance given
the choice.
The third is that the judgment will be used to obtain performance and
not some other ends. Specific performance is favored for awarding the
promisee with exactly what she expected to receive, i.e., performance.33 If the
promisee uses the right for some other end besides performance, then even if
this end is not objectionable in its own right, it would require a separate
justification besides expectation of performance.34
and Its Limits, 95 HARV. L. REV. 741, 744–45 n.10 (1982) (“[I]n those cases in which [specific
performance] is feasible, it is often simply a special technique for putting plaintiff in the position
he would have been in if the contract had been performed.”); Nathan B. Oman, The Failure of
Economic Interpretations of the Law of Contract Damages, 64 WASH. & LEE L. REV. 829, 869
(2007) (“[S]o long as damages compensate the promisee for her loss, we ought to choose the
remedy that intrudes on liberty the least.” This account implies that specific performance is
closer to the value of promised performance.); Shiffrin, Breach of Contract, supra note 25, at
1566 (“[T]he practice of making [contracts] could not flourish or perform its function if paying
expectation damages became the default method of their satisfaction. But, the practice would
flourish if performance were the default method of satisfaction.”).
32 See Michael D. Knobler, A Dual Approach to Contract Remedies, 30 YALE L. & POL’Y
REV. 415, 427 (2012) (arguing that specific performance is the solution for the under-
compensatory nature of expectation damages so that it will be in the promisee’s interest). Also,
most of the authors noted in the previous note can also be read in this light, as they are generally
aware of practical impediments to enforcement, although it is unclear whether these
considerations play more than a secondary role in their analysis.
33 See generally Shavell, supra note 11.
34 While in principle a right to something implies the power to sell it or use it in other ways,
this is not why most promise-based theories believe specific performance is appropriate. Using
the judgment for financial gain may actually be frowned upon. After all, if the goal was to give
the plaintiff greater bargaining power rather than the right to performance, these theories would
have advocated super compensatory remedies, which they do not. See KAPLOW & SHAVELL,
supra note 5, 161–62 (surveying the role of super compensatory remedies in promise based
theories).

B. Economic Theories
1. Common Structure
Normative economic theories are consequentialist moral theories that
adopt some variant of welfarism. As such, economic theories focus solely on
the consequences of legal rules and rank their desirability exclusively on the
basis of their effect on overall social welfare, however aggregated.35 In the
context of contract law, this leads to the claim that the choice of remedies
should be decided solely by what would maximize the parties’ joint interests at
the time of contracting.36
The exact role of specific performance within the economic framework
is complex: four decades of analysis have demonstrated that a myriad of
parameters are relevant to the choice of remedies.37 Opponents of specific
performance argue, for example, that this remedy can lead promisors to
perform even when it is inefficient for them to do so. While the promisee might
be willing to give up her right to performance in exchange for due
compensation, a right to specific performance could engender a hold-up
scenario where the promisee uses the judgment to extract high payments from
the promisor. To protect himself, the promisor would need to take wasteful ex-
ante measures against breach.38 Moreover, the enforcement of specific
performance is likely to be complicated and costly in cases involving the
rendering of a service or the production of goods (as opposed to the
35 See Amartya Sen, Utilitarianism and Welfarism, 76 J. PHIL. 463, 468 (1979). For a
development of these ideas, see KAPLOW & SHAVELL, supra note 5, at 15–85, 403–65, and Louis
Kaplow & Steven Shavell, Any Non-Welfarist Method of Policy Assessment Violates the Pareto
Principle, 109 J. POL. ECON. 281, 281–86 (2001) (explaining that non-exclusive approaches will
lead to prescriptions that would make some people worse off while not benefitting anyone).
36 For early proponents of the ex-ante joint interests perspective of contract damages, see
Steven Shavell, Damage Measures for Breach of Contract, 11 BELL J. ECON. 466 (1980), and
RICHARD A. POSNER, ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF LAW (2d ed. 1977). In the past, some purportedly
economic analyses were focused on minimizing ex-post waste, failing to consider the ex-ante
effects of so doing. See the critical review in Robert E. Scott & Alan Schwartz, Market Damages,
Efficient Contracting, and the Economic Waste Fallacy, 108 COLUM. L. REV. 1610, 1614–16
(2008).
37 See Richard Craswell, Contract Remedies, Renegotiation, and the Theory of Efficient
Breach, 61 S. CAL. L. REV. 629 (1988) (arguing that choice of remedies has a variety of incentive
effects on all stages of contracting, from searching for partners to breach decisions); Eric A.
Posner, Economic Analysis of Contract Law After Three Decades: Success or Failure?, 112
YALE L.J. 829 (2003) (criticizing law and economics for not providing any determinate answers
to the core questions of contractual doctrine and using contract remedies as a key example).
38 See Shavell, supra note 11, at 844–45 (exploring wasteful precautions against breach
taken by the promisor).

380 WEST VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 118
conveyance of ready-made goods).39 Proponents, on the other hand, claim that
if performance is inefficient, the parties will trade in the specific performance
award, and the transaction costs involved will likely be low enough to facilitate
that.40 Specific performance should be preferred, on these views, because it can
capture the value of performance to the promisee while avoiding the costly
process of damages quantification.41 Finally, specific performance can be
desirable because it encourages breach only when breach is clearly efficient,
whereas expectation damages, which are often under-compensatory, could lead
to excessively frequent breach.
2. Common Assumptions
As noted, economic theory is far from settled on whether specific
performance is desirable. Of the various assumptions made, let me note three.
First, it is expected that parties would generally try to engage in some
form of post-judgment renegotiation. The fact of breach suggests that
performance is inefficient and therefore the parties could both benefit from
trading the right to specific performance for some payment.42 This would
require transaction costs to be low, but they usually are in contractual settings.43
Consequently, efficiency-minded judges need not overly worry about the
disposition of rights, as those rights will be efficiently traded.44 Indeed, these
39 See Alan Schwartz, The Case for Specific Performance, 89 YALE L.J. 271, 292–96 (1979)
(discussing various “administrative” costs of enforcing specific performance); Shavell, supra
note 11, at 833 (exploring the different costs of specific enforcement of contracts to produce
goods and contracts to convey property and arguing that costs would be significantly lower in the
latter case).
40 See, e.g., Ian R. Macneil, Efficient Breach of Contract: Circles in the Sky, 68 VA. L. REV.
947, 951–53 (1982).
41 See Schwartz, supra note 39.
42 See, e.g., Benjamin E. Hermalin et al., Contract Law, in THE HANDBOOK OF LAW AND
ECONOMICS 3, 117–18 (A. Mitchell Polinsky & Steven Shavell eds., 2007).
43 Most contractual disputes involve two to three direct parties, who knew each other well
enough to transact in the first place. See THOMAS J. MICELI, ECONOMICS OF THE LAW 88 (1997)
(“Presumably, transaction costs are low in most contract settings, given that the parties have
already demonstrated an ability to bargain.”); A. Mitchell Polinsky & Steven Shavell, Law,
Economic Analysis of, in THE NEW PALGRAVE DICTIONARY OF ECONOMICS 1, 19 (Steven N.
Durlauf & Lawrence E. Blume eds., 2d ed. 2008) (“[M]uch of the economics literature . . .
assumes that renegotiation always occurs.”).
44 The core idea stems from Ronald H. Coase, The Problem of Social Cost, 3 J. L. & ECON. 1
(1960), but is adapted to the legal context by the work of Guido Calabresi & A. Douglas
Melamed, Property Rules, Liability Rules, and Inalienability: One View of the Cathedral, 85
HARV. L. REV. 1089, 1106–10 (1972) (arguing that due to informational advantages parties have
over the social planner, liability rules should be assigned only in places where transaction costs
prohibit efficient negotiations between the parties), which was later expanded to the specific
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1641438
2015] CONTRACT REMEDIES IN ACTION 381
negotiations might break down, but the expectation is that the parties will at
least attempt to renegotiate.45
Second, there is a common assumption, although not universal, that the
value of the renegotiated agreement would be equal to or exceed the value of
the performance to the promisee. If it would not, the promisee could simply
insist on performance and receive performance value. This is what underlies the
justification of specific performance as protecting the promisee’s subjective
value; the opposition to specific performance as engendering a hold-up
scenario; and the concern that if promisees will be given a choice, they will
flood the courts with specific performance suits.46
Third, there is much concern with which remedy would be more
efficient, but pronouncedly less interest in the effects of letting promisees
choose their remedies. Specifically, there is no account of how providing such a
choice could affect plaintiff-attorney or plaintiff-court interactions and strategic
behavior, either due to an oversight or to a more concrete assumption that such
effects are of marginal relevance.
III. THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK
In Common Law, expectation damages are the default remedy.47 The
hallmark of this preference is the oft-cited, and arguably misunderstood,48
quote of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes that the duty to keep a contract “means
performance domain in Anthony T. Kronman, Specific Performance, 45 U. CHI. L. REV. 351,
351–55 (1978).
45 Most economic studies of specific performance make this assumption. See, e.g., Polinsky
& Shavell, supra note 43.
46 See, e.g., MICELI, supra note 43, at 88 (“[S]pecific performance protects the promisee’s
subjective valuation of performance.”); see also Hermalin et al., supra note 42, at 113 (“[I]f the
buyer has the threat of a remedy of specific performance, thereby requiring the seller to incur the
costs of performance, that should allow the buyer to capture more of the gains than he could if
his only legal threat were to hold the seller responsible for some smaller monetary remedy.”);
Harrison, supra note 15, at 196 (“Routine availability of specific performance means the worst-
case scenario for the non-breaching party will be full compensation while, in the case of
expectancy, it is merely a possibility.”); Jimenez, supra note 13, at 69 (arguing that specific
performance will lead to compensation over and above the value of performance to the
promisee).
47 This preference dates back to Lord Coke, in Bromage v. Genning (1616) 81 Eng. Rep.
540.
48 See Joseph M. Perillo, Misreading Oliver Wendell Holmes on Efficient Breach and
Tortious Interference, 68 FORDHAM L. REV. 1085, 1086 n.6 (2000) (quoting Holmes’ letter to Sir
Frederick Pollock, saying that “I don’t think a man promises to pay damages in contract any
more than in tort. He commits an act that makes him liable for them if a certain event does not
come to pass, just as his act in tort makes him liable simpliciter.” (quoting OLIVER W. HOLMES ET
AL., HOLMES-POLLOCK LETTERS: THE CORRESPONDENCE OF MR. JUSTICE HOLMES AND SIR
FREDERICK POLLOCK, 1874–1932, 233 (Mark DeWolfe Howe ed., Harvard Univ. Press 1941)).

a prediction that you must pay damages if you do not keep it,—and nothing
else.”49 As a result, specific performance is only awarded in cases in which
damages are deemed inadequate.50 Categories of such cases evolved over time,
some being mundane (e.g. sale of land) while others border on the esoteric (e.g.
contracts for the sale of standing timber).51 Even if damages are found to be
inadequate, specific performance will not be granted if it imposes a
disproportionate amount of hardship on the defendant, requires excess
supervision by the courts, or does not serve the public interest.52
While there is some debate on whether the granting of specific
performance has been liberalized by section 2-716(1) of the Uniform
Commercial Code,53 many still believe that specific performance is the
exception rather than the rule.54
For this reason, this study sought a jurisdiction which is similar enough
to the Common Law but has the Civil Law feature of setting specific
performance as the preferred remedy. This is at the behest of previous
scholarship that urged such an investigation.55 Israel provided exactly such an
opportunity, as it mixes Civil and Common Law elements. Importantly, Israeli
contract law is sufficiently close to United States law to draw meaningful
conclusions, and the rest of this Part will note the main points of similarity as
well as the role specific performance plays.56

is not specific performance but expectation damages.”). But see Barbara H. Fried, What’s
Morality Got to Do with It?, 120 HARV. L. REV. F. 53 (2009) (criticizing Shiffrin for overlooking
modern trends in the availability of specific performance). There is also some empirical evidence
that supports the view that specific performance is liberally granted. See Douglas Laycock, The
Death of the Irreparable Injury Rule, 103 HARV. L. REV. 687, 707 (1990).
55 See Shavell, supra note 11, at 876 (“It would thus be fruitful for researchers in the future
to gather information about parties’ choice of remedy for breach . . . using social scientific
empirical methodology. Of particular value would be information about parties’ choice of
remedy in Germany for contracts to produce things or to perform services, since specific
performance is the general remedy there.”). Germany is similar to Israel in that specific
performance is the default remedy although Israel allows for specific performance in a broader
range of circumstances.

Daphne Barak-Erez, Codification and Legal Culture: In Comparative Perspective, 13 TUL. EUR.

2015] CONTRACT REMEDIES IN ACTION 383
Israeli contract law is an amalgam of statutory legislation and common
law.57 Like American Law, it is also largely substance centric, and much of the
modern law is judge-made. Israeli judges often cite to American law as a
source of inspiration, and many American doctrines and cases such as Hadley
v. Baxendale, Leonard v. Pepsico, and Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. are
routinely taught in law schools, analyzed in Israeli scholarship, and cited by
judges.58
If a contract is breached, the aggrieved party has the option of choosing
her remedies, including specific performance where feasible.59 If specific relief
is sought, it will be granted unless the defendant can prove that certain statutory
exceptions obtain, mainly that the relief would be “unjust” because, for
example, delay on the promisee’s part has made performance too costly.60
Specific performance is not only the default remedy, it is considered
morally superior to damages. As such, it is commonly referred to by courts and
scholars alike as being “the first and foremost” among all other remedies.61
Conversely, expectation damages are viewed as inducing morally wrongful
behavior, subjecting the promise to financial calculation by the promisor. This
sentiment is traceable to civil law and, presumably, has its roots in Canon
Law.62
To enforce a specific performance, three main venues exist.63 The
plaintiff could file a petition for an order of contempt, and the court has broad
formal discretion in choosing sanctions, whether financial or criminal.64
However, this is not a penal procedure and is only used to achieve performance

influenced by English and American law.”); see also Jonathan Yovel & Ido Shacham, An
Overview of Israeli Contract Law, in THE INTERNATIONAL CONTRACT MANUAL (2014).

59 In my own analysis of 100 randomly chosen cases where specific performance was

performance in an additional 15% (for a total of 60%). For the methodology employed, see infra

and never to punish for non-performance.65 Courts are wary of this specific
power and tend to limit its use.66
Alternatively, the Enforcement and Collection Agency is a government
run agency that is designed to assist creditors in enforcing contractual
obligation, and has numerous powers, including the ability to foreclose and
seize property, as well as to place liens on bank accounts, to order wage
garnishment, and to limit international travel. Lastly, the plaintiff may file for
appointment as a receiver over the defendant’s assets or company, but this is
rarely invoked.67
In summary, while the general structure of Israeli law of contracts and
private law in general exhibits strong semblances to American law, the two
systems diverge on the prominence of remedies. The (arguable) liberalization
of contract remedies in American law further emphasizes the value of the study
of a jurisdiction where specific performance is unambiguously set as default.
IV. METHODOLOGY
The basis of the empirical investigation is an exploratory qualitative
study—interviews with relevant stakeholders in Israel.68 The choice of this
methodology is driven by the absence of previous empirical work of this kind
on this issue and the theoretical gap created by this omission, strongly felt by
prior scholarship.69 The goal here, in general terms, is to capture the law-as-it-
is-experienced,70 owing to the familiar insight that a great deal of individual
action takes place in the “shadow of the law.”71
65 See CrimA 6/50 Levitt v. Angel, 4 PD 5710 459 (1950) (Isr.).
66 See CC 6807/06 Kugler v. Kugler, (not reported) (2007) (Isr.).
67 See DAVID KATZIR, REMEDIES FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, pt. A, at 356, 378–80 (1991)
(Isr.).
68 The interviews were conducted based on the ethical approval of the Institutional Review
Board (IRB), IRB protocol no. 15682.
69 See Shavell, supra note 11, at 876 (“It would thus be fruitful for researchers in the future
to gather information about parties’ choice of remedy for breach . . . using social scientific
empirical methodology.”).
70 See PIERGIORGIO CORBETTA, SOCIAL RESEARCH: THEORY, METHODS AND TECHNIQUES 264
(2003) (“[The interview’s] basic objective remains that of grasping the subject’s perspective:
understanding his mental categories, his interpretations, his perceptions and feelings, and the
motives underlying his actions.”).
71 The shadow of the law paradigm was coined by Robert H. Mnookin and Lewis
Kornhauser, Bargaining in the Shadow of the Law: The Case of Divorce, 88 YALE L.J. 950
(1979). A famous study in this vein is Stewart Macaulay, Non-Contractual Relations in Business:
A Preliminary Study, 28 AM. SOC. REV. 55 (1963) (studying through interviews contractual
behavior of businesspersons in Wisconsin). There are also studies that suggest that certain social
structures substitute the formal law, so that parties operate in the shadow of social norms. See

Obtaining the cooperation of parties to private litigation and asking
them to volunteer sensitive private information is difficult.72 Acquiring a
random statistically representative sample was bound to fail; instead, a
“maximum variation” approach was employed, meaning that the group
assembled was meant to represent a heavily diverse group of participants.73 The
results should therefore be interpreted as providing insight into different groups
within the population, but not as being representative of the frequency of the
phenomena described.74
The relevant population from which the sample was drawn is
comprised of all cases reported to a commercial database (Nevo) matching
relevant general criteria, such as the dates and the subject matter of contracts.
These cases were ordered randomly, and in each case, at least one of the parties
or their lawyers were contacted. Consent to participate was acquired in 18 cases
(in approximately 60 cases contact was attempted, implying about 36%
response rate). The number of participants chosen reflects similar past scholarly
work in contracts and other fields of law.75
Demographics: 6 interviewees were private parties who had been
involved in specific performance litigation over the past 10 years (of which one
was a CEO of a company), 11 were lawyers, and 1 was a magistrate judge
acting as the head of a local office of the Enforcement and Collection
Agency.76 Of the private parties, five had prevailed in litigation as plaintiffs and
one had lost as a defendant. Of the lawyers, four lawyers were senior partners,
and one was a senior associate in one of Israel’s top law firms (all reported
heavy involvement, at least in the strategic management of the case); another
(providing evidence of social norms of dispute resolution that diverge from legal prescriptions);
Lisa Bernstein, Opting Out of the Legal System: Extralegal Contractual Relations in the
Diamond Industry, 21 J. LEGAL STUD. 115 (1992) (describing internal dispute resolution
mechanisms in the diamond industry).
72 Other obstacles included the acquisition of parties’ contact information from legal cases
and providing motivation to contribute their time for the sake of the study.
73 See SARAH J. TRACY, QUALITATIVE RESEARCH METHODS 135–36 (2013).
74 Such an approach is common in qualitative studies. See, e.g., CORBETTA, supra note 70, at
268 (stating that “the qualitative researcher does not follow a criterion of statistical
representativeness, but rather one of substantive representativeness, in that the aim is to cover all
the social situations that are relevant to the research, rather than attempting to reproduce the
characteristics of the population in full”); see also MATTHEW B. MILES, A. MICHAEL HUBERMAN
& JOHNNY SALDAÑA, QUALITATIVE DATA ANALYSIS 31 (3d ed. 2013) (“Qualitative samples tend
to be purposive rather than random.”).
75 See Keating, supra note 8, at 100 (13 interviewees); Farnsworth, supra note 9, at 382

Maculay and his research assistants, covering 68 interviewees. Macaulay, supra note 71.

four were affiliated with mid-sized law firms, whereas the remaining two
lawyers were employed by small law firms.77
The interviews were all conducted by the Author and followed a semi-
structured research protocol, which is a combination of standard questions,
specific inquiries concerning the case, and dynamic follow-ups to respondents’
responses. In the course of the interview, the facts of the case were reviewed;
then, the interviewee was asked about her motivations and experiences in both
the pre-trial and post-trial stage. Lawyers were asked about their own
motivations and that of their clients’. Hypothetical questions were used to elicit
information on the attitudes of the parties.
Before proceeding, the point should be restated that the current
methodology does not aim to represent the distribution of cases generally, but
only speaks to the existence of certain phenomena. Having said that, the
findings reported here are those that there is good reason to believe would be of
general application.
V. FINDINGS ON SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE PRE-JUDGMENT
With the theoretical background in mind, let us move now to describe
the findings. I start by examining how plaintiffs choose between remedies when
they litigate their case.
A preliminary finding is that plaintiffs opt-out of specific performance
in what seems like many cases. This is somewhat surprising as theory imputes a
higher value to specific performance than to money damages. To explain this
unlikely finding, the interviews suggest three reasons: low enforceability might
make specific performance inferior to expectation damages in terms of value;
attorneys are biased in favor of money damages, as they facilitate collection of
their own fees, so that they might consult the plaintiff to pursue this remedy
even when it runs counter to the client’s interests; and finally, litigation is
lengthy and plaintiffs’ preferences are dynamic—suing for money damages
might be safer for the plaintiff even when she currently prefers performance to
money damages.
But even when plaintiffs act consistent with theory and sue for specific
performance, their motivations are more involved than is generally appreciated.
Suing for specific performance may be motivated by a desire to signal to the
court something about the merits of the case, to minimize procedural costs and
delay, or to use as leverage in negotiations. These uses may or may not be
objectionable on their own right, but they clearly deviate from the common
justification of specific performance as giving the plaintiffs what was promised
in the contract.
77 Future endeavors to increase sample size should include a greater sample of people who
have lost in litigation and had to perform. This demographic proved especially interesting and
fruitful in this study.

A. Why Do Parties Not Sue More Frequently for Specific Performance?
When plaintiffs file a lawsuit for breach of contract, they have a choice
between various remedies, including specific performance and expectation
damages.78 The conventional wisdom in the literature is that, given the option,
plaintiffs would tend to sue for specific performance. First, promisees are
sometimes seen as the disappointed victims of a breach, which will not be
remedied by mere payment of money.79 Second, promisees are expected to
benefit from the judgment indirectly, even if they do not care about
performance, as they can use it as a bargaining chip to extract value from the
promisor.80
However, early in the process of the research, there were various
indications that parties regularly abstain from suing for specific performance,
despite having the right to do so.81 First, a sample analysis of contract cases
found that specific performance was only sought in a minority of these cases
(much fewer than 33%).82 By itself, however, this is an ambiguous finding, as it
does not convey information on the population of cases that settle.83 To
overcome this problem, and to get a sense of the overall population of cases, a
question was included on the choice of remedies for all the lawyers
interviewed, as they have been involved also in cases that settle. Consequently,
some of the lawyers reported that they frequently advise their clients to opt for
expectation damages over specific performance, and that, from their
78 See supra Part II.
79 See Shiffrin, Breach of Contract, supra note 25, at 1564 (“If the no-show plumber were to
appear next time matter-of-factly presenting you with a check or a discount reflecting the value
of your time that was wasted, I suspect that, after emerging from shock, the resentment would not
fully dissipate.”).
80 For the proposition that renegotiation with a specific performance judgment in hand would
yield high value to the promisee, see, for example, Daniel Markovits & Alan Schwartz, The
Expectation Remedy Revisited, 98 VA. L. REV. 1093, 1102 (2012) (“[T]he property rights
contract [i.e., specific performance] induces an ex post renegotiation, in which the promisee
releases the promisor from her trade obligation in exchange for a share of the gains that the
release engenders.”).
81 Importantly, note that as a general matter, laypersons tend to exaggerate the rates at which
specific performance will be given. See Tess Wilkinson-Ryan, Fault in Contracts: A
Psychological Approach, in FAULT IN AMERICAN CONTRACT LAW 289, 293, 298 (Omri Ben-
Shahar & Ariel Porat eds., 2010) (finding in an experiment run in the U.S. that respondents
believed a judge should and would award specific performance even in circumstances where
such a prediction was unlikely).
82 The methodology consisted of identifying a pool of 900 cases in one of the commercial
databases (Nevo) that met criteria indicating that they deal with contract remedies within a given
time range. Three hundred of the cases were analyzed, and in only 102 of them, specific
performance was sought. This indicates that, roughly, specific performance is sought in about
one-third of the cases.
83 See supra note 22.

388 WEST VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 118
experience, specific performance is frequently not sued. These findings are
bolstered by similar findings in civil law countries where expectation damages
are chosen over specific performance.84 The following sections explore several
reasons for this deviation from theoretical prediction.
1. Low Enforceability
Parts VI and VII detail various impediments to both post-judgment
renegotiation and the enforcement of judgments. For now, it should be noted
that the existence of such impediments has two implications: first, these
impediments mean that there is no guarantee that the judgment would
eventually be sold, so that if a party is not interested in performance, suing for
specific performance carries a risk. Second, the value of the sale of the
judgment in renegotiation might be low, as the threat of enforcement would
have a weak bite on the promisor. If the promisor knows he can effectively
avoid the enforcement of the judgment, he might be willing to pay a low sum in
exchange for release from it, an amount that might be lower than expectation
damages. That means that suing for specific performance in order to use it as a
bargaining chip to extract extra payments from the promisor might end up
being a losing proposition.
2. The Lawyers’ Agency Problem
An analysis of the interviews reveals an important contributor for low
rates of specific performance litigation: a conflict of interest of the plaintiff’s
attorney regarding their fees.85 For reasons presently explored, lawyers have a
systematic bias towards money damages, and this bias may lead them to sway
their clients in favor of seeking money damages even when the client’s best
interest is served by a specific performance award.86
84 A similar finding is noted in Henrik Lando & Caspar Rose, On the Enforcement of
Specific Performance in Civil Law Countries, 24 INT’L REV. L. ECON. 473, 486 (2004)
(“[Specific performance] is available but rarely sought in Germany and France.”); see also John
P. Dawson, Specific Performance in France and Germany, 57 MICH. L. REV. 495, 530 (1959)
(“But despite . . . formal limitations the damage remedy is in fact resorted to, by the choice of
litigants, in a high percentage of cases.”); Bernard Rudden & Philippe Juilhard, La Théorie de la
Violation Efficace, 38 REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE DROIT COMPARÉ 1015, 1035 para. 72 (1986)
(observing that, practically, damages are the most sought after remedy in France, despite the
general legal priority of specific performance).
85 See generally Herbert M. Kritzer, Lawyer Fees and Lawyer Behavior in Litigation: What
Does the Empirical Literature Really Say?, 80 TEX. L. REV. 1943 (2002) (discussing the various
effects of attorney fees on their behavior and noting the complexity of this question).
86 This may be considered malpractice, but proving this in court would be difficult, as
lawyers’ motives may be easily disguised.
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1641438
2015] CONTRACT REMEDIES IN ACTION 389
One issue arises when lawyers are paid on the basis of a contingency
fee. Structuring a specific performance decree so it will be effective requires a
lot of dedicated work by the attorney, for which she is not compensated.
Moreover, assessing attorney fees requires the evaluation of the market value of
performance. This is difficult, costly, and open to conflicting interpretations,
and in fact, quite often plaintiffs sue for specific performance because they
wish to avoid these costs.87 One lawyer referred to this prospect as a “needless
headache.”88 Instead, lawyers can steer the client to sue for a damages suit,
where these issues are avoided.89
But even if attorneys are not paid on a contingency basis, specific
performance is less favorable, because of the problem of collecting the fees.90
With expectation damages, the client’s liquidity is assured, but this may not be
the case with respect to specific performance of a good or service. Moreover,
the lawyer enjoys a mechanic’s lien on damages awards, which guarantees her
fees.91 The lawyer would have a private incentive, again, to recommend suing
for specific performance.
3. Preferences over Time
People have different tastes and preferences at different times of their
lives. This is obviously a familiar point, but it is of special interest in the
context of specific performance litigation, due to an expected change in
preferences over both the performance and the relationship with the other
party.92
One of the lawyers related the case of a client who bought a brand new
model of a luxury car.93 The retailer committed an inventory mistake and could
not supply the car on time. The client and the lawyer decided jointly against
filing a claim for specific performance. Considering the fact that litigation
87 See, e.g., Kronman, supra note 44, at 362 (“In asserting that the subject matter of a
particular contract is unique and has no established market value, a court is really saying that it
cannot obtain, at a reasonable cost, enough information about substitutes to permit it to calculate
an award of money damages without imposing an unacceptably high risk of undercompensation
on the injured promisee.”).

89 Lawyers incentives have a marked effect on the choice of litigation strategy. See generally

would take a few years to resolve,94 the client would have no use for the car.
The parties contemplated the possibility of suing under the doctrine of cy-pres
or “approximate performance,” i.e., suing for another new car from the same
manufacturer.95 However, this option was rejected as well, because the client
was not sure whether he would still be interested in this brand of car in the
future.
Another change in preferences relates to the relationship between the
parties. At the time of contracting, the relationship is benign. However, the
litigation process is aimed at finding who is at fault and not to remedy the
pathologies of the underlying relationship. Consequently, some of the
interviewees reported that the litigation process exacerbated existing tensions
between the parties and created animosity;96 and when asked about the other
parties, one of the interviewees responded in the following typical way,
describing him as “stiff-necked and economical with the truth.”97
The adverse relational effect of litigation is of special concern in cases
of specific performance, as the decree implies greater future interaction than is
expected with a damages award. This issue reduces the relative value of
specific performance vis-à-vis expectation damages, even when the direct
financial value of performance is still higher.
In sum, change in preferences would reduce the value of specific
performance, as it requires plaintiffs to bear the risk that they would change
their mind over the course of litigation.
B. Why Do Parties Sue for Specific Performance?
Of course, there are also cases where specific performance is indeed
sought. As this is the basic premise of the literature, it may seem that it would
require no further justification. As the interviews reveal, however, parties sue
for specific performance not only for the reasons assumed in the literature, but
also for different reasons that are more strategic in nature: signaling of the
merit of the underlying case, the minimization of procedural costs and delays,
and leverage in post-judgment renegotiation.98
94 Contract litigation is relatively lengthy. An earlier study reports a median of 17.8 months
for cases that go to trial on the federal level (24.8 in the state level). See Theodore Eisenberg et
al., Litigation Outcomes in State and Federal Courts: A Statistical Portrait, 19 SEATTLE U. L.
REV. 433, 448 (1996).

INST. 1981).

2015] CONTRACT REMEDIES IN ACTION 391
1. Signaling
For the plaintiff to be awarded a remedy for a breached contract, the
court must be first convinced that the plaintiff is in the right. This is often not a
simple task. Contractual breaches are typically a nuanced dynamic of escalating
breaches, which involve varying degrees of fault by both parties. It is common
in these situations that the plaintiff would face allegations of bad faith or prior
breach by the defendant, making it essential to prove the good faith of the
plaintiff.
When the plaintiff has a choice of remedies, the choice made can be
taken as a signal of the merits of the case.99 In this context, one of the lawyers
interviewed complained that it is difficult to opt for expectation damages
without sending an unwanted signal to the court. The concern is that the court
might infer that if the plaintiff opts for monetary compensation instead of
performance, she is not sincere in her motives and that she is “in it for the
money.”100 Since judges constantly extol the moral merits of specific
performance, choosing the “wrong” remedy might convey the wrong message.
In other words, by choosing to deviate from the default of specific
performance, the plaintiff signals that she no longer has interest in the contract,
which may weaken the plaintiff’s position in litigation. It may well be the case
that neither party is interested in the actual performance of the contract, yet the
benefits of signaling and thus winning the case may outweigh the costs of
performance to the plaintiff.
2. Achieving Faster, Cheaper Case Resolution
The procedure for specific performance actions is much faster and
cheaper than the corresponding procedure for damages. The reason is
straightforward: a specific performance case does not involve the quantification
of damages, which is a highly complex and expensive procedure that involves
experts, the introduction of various evidence, bringing witnesses, and so
forth.101
reputation as being performance-oriented. See Edward Yorio, In Defense of Money Damages for
Breach of Contract, 82 COLUM. L. REV. 1365, 1373 (1982).
99 It is rational for courts to draw this inference, because sending this signal is more costly
for someone who is not interested in the performance of the contract than it is for someone who
seeks performance. Alternative interpretation of opting for specific performance is that the
plaintiff places an especially high value on performance and inasmuch as it would increase her
odds of winning, we might expect this to contribute to the overuse of this remedy.
100 Interview with Ram Zan, Esq., Ron Gazit, Rotenberg & Co. (Dec. 29, 2008) [hereinafter
Zan, Interview].
101 If—as is the case under American law—the plaintiff has to show the inadequacy of
damages to receive specific performance, this will introduce additional costs that would reduce
the cost saving involved.
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1641438
392 WEST VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 118
By opting for a specific performance suit, the plaintiff can economize
on litigation costs (for both himself and the defendant). The shorter period it
takes to litigate the case will reduce costs and might be beneficial to both the
parties and the public.102
This benefit may accrue even if the plaintiff intends to ultimately
renegotiate the decree, which means that quantification would be required (for
trade to occur). But it may still be beneficial to sue for specific relief and then
renegotiate if the parties have a comparative advantage over the court in
quantifying damages and a comparative disadvantage over the court in
assigning fault.103
Some of the interviewees reported suing for specific performance for
these reasons. For example, a lawyer reported that he was facing litigation that
combined both motions for specific performance and for damages. In litigation,
he tried to separate the proceedings despite the costs involved in handling two
separate suits, because he felt that the benefits of the quicker and cheaper
resolution of the specific performance suit outweighed the additional costs of
having two distinct cases.104
3. Post-Judgment Renegotiation
Finally, the interviews revealed that in some cases parties were at least
partially motivated by the ability to sell their rights to the other party ex-post.105
This is in line with much of economic theory that predicts such a result, but is
surprisingly at odds with a previous study (albeit in torts) that found that post-
judgment renegotiations are scarce.106
VI. POST-JUDGMENT RENEGOTIATION AND ITS FAILURES
With the judgment in hand, the parties may seek to renegotiate. A
common theme in economic analysis is the notion that if performance is
inefficient—which the fact of breach suggests it is—the parties may benefit
102 However, Alan Schwartz contends that specific performance decrees may be more costly
to issue than expectation damages, as the judge would have to spend considerable time
fashioning the decree. See Schwartz, supra note 39, at 293.
103 The theory of the bifurcation of the litigation process is complex and the merits of so
doing may depend on a broad set of parameters. See Kathryn E. Spier, Litigation, in THE
HANDBOOK OF LAW AND ECONOMICS 259, 293–95 (A. Mitchell Polinsky & Steven Shavell eds.,
2007) (reviewing some of the considerations that factor into the decision to bifurcate suits).

from agreeing not to enforce the judgment in exchange for some payment.107
Despite that, the leading research on the topic of post-judgment renegotiation
(“PJR”) has found that in nuisance cases, no PJR took place. 108 This makes an
investigation of this issue in the context of specific performance especially
important.
The analysis finds that specific performance PJR sometimes takes
place: of the interviewees, two reported that they were engaged in successful
PJR.109 One was a defendant who lost in a specific performance suit and was
ordered to transfer title in a house to the plaintiff. He actively avoided the
enforcement of the judgment for a few years, and so the plaintiff found it
necessary to renegotiate the judgment, and they have settled for half the price
of the value of the judgment. In another case, the PJR failed apparently because
of mistrust and a hard bargain by the defendant.110 In addition, one lawyer
reported that he had been involved in “some” PJRs throughout his career.111
However, PJRs do not always occur—that is, in some cases, parties do
not even attempt to renegotiate the claim.112 As noted, this is puzzling from an
economic perspective. And while it is only indicative, the analysis of the
reasons for failure of PJR suggests that the failure has to do more with
psychological reasons than lack of potential gains from trade: animosity, the
endowment effect, and an incommensurability bias.
Consider first the issue of animosity. Breach of contract, and
specifically the process of litigation, can lead to the entrenchment of the
mistrust between the parties, making them skeptical of any new agreement.
Moreover, the mistrust may escalate to actual spite between the parties, which
will further motivate them not to negotiate.113 For example, in one of the cases,
the parties sat down and negotiated a settlement. The defendant asked, “How
much would you be asking in settlement?”; but the plaintiffs thought it was a

outcomes will generally facilitate renegotiations. Korobkin & Ulen, supra note 112, at 1137–38.

legal trick, aimed at showing in court that the plaintiffs were cynically
motivated by financial calculations and did not care about the contract.
Therefore, the plaintiffs refused to answer and the negotiations broke down.114
In the case of specific performance, animosity has conflicting effects;
on the one hand, it makes it harder to reach an agreement, for the parties may
mistrust and dislike each other. On the other hand, it makes both parties want to
successfully negotiate, because failure in negotiation means that they both have
to contend with each other for a longer period, during the implementation of the
decree. The direction of the combined effect of these factors is hard to predict,
but in some cases, this may make parties reluctant to negotiate even when it is
in their best financial and emotional interests to do so.
Now consider the endowment effect. This is the name given to the
experimental result that subjects report higher value for things they own just by
virtue of owning them. The so-called endowment of a subject with an object,
changes none of the characteristics of this object, yet people often report that
they will require a high payment to trade it, higher than the maximum amount
they would be willing to pay for it. The problem, noted by legal behaviorists, is
that litigation seems to instill a sense of endowment in the litigants. Jolls,
Sunstein, and Thaler explain:
[T]he process of going through litigation may strengthen the
endowment effect. Experimental evidence suggests that there is
an especially strong endowment effect when a party believes
that he has earned the entitlement or that he particularly
deserves it. Of course someone who has received a court
judgment in his favor will believe that he has earned it. Such a
person may also believe strongly that this outcome is fair.115
This is expected to be of special relevance in the specific performance
context, as the judgment often represents an actual good or service (unlike
money damages in an ordinary judgment), to which the plaintiff may feel
entitled or otherwise connected. And while a study of this kind cannot prove
the existence of such bias, the impression from parties’ rhetoric is that some
sense of ownership underlies their reluctance to renegotiate. Parties often spoke
of their judgments as things “belonging to them,” which is in line with past

2015] CONTRACT REMEDIES IN ACTION 395
scholarship.116 Endowment effects have the potential for limiting the range of
possible settlements, thus leading to potential PJR failure.117
A final issue is what I term the incommensurability bias. All
throughout the interviews, parties’ responses indicated that they avoid thinking
of their judgment in terms of its monetary value. More precisely, they exhibit
an aversion to reducing the judgment to its monetary value, and attach
symbolic meaning to it. They tend to think of specific performance as
qualitatively different from damages. This finding also emerges in other
qualitative empirical works in other areas of law.118 As parties seem to perceive
it, specific performance is entitling the party to the fulfillment of the promise,
whereas damages only suggest entitlement to lost profits.119
When asked about their motivations, a recurring comment was that
“one wants a specific apartment, a specific type of a building.”120 And while
parties claimed that they wanted the specific good in question,121 when asked
whether they would have sold their right for a very large amount of money,
these plaintiffs all said that they would have; however, none of them actively
tried to negotiate such a high sum, and all relevant interviewees seemed to
think of the monetary aspect as qualitatively different from their contractual
entitlement. On the other hand, lawyers representing large firms all reported
that their clients had no problem renegotiating their judgments and reducing
them to their monetary value was “natural.” Since corporations are major
players in specific performance litigation,122 the implications of the
irreducibility problem are somewhat limited.
116 See Korobkin & Ulen, supra note 112, at 1107–12 (discussing the endowment effect and
its consequences for the ability of parties to renegotiate injunctions and judgments).
117 A subtle theoretical question is whether negotiation breakdown due to endowment effects
represent an efficiency loss or whether the effect actually creates subjective value. Id. at 1111.
118 See Farnsworth, supra note 9, at 392–94 (arguing that parties exhibit a refusal to
“commodify” injunctions in torts despite a financial incentive to do so).
119 Various psychological experiments seem to support the lay understanding of conceiving of
specific performance as being qualitatively different from expectation damages. See, e.g., Tess
Wilkinson-Ryan & David A. Hoffman, Breach Is for Suckers, 63 VAND. L. REV. 1003, 1016
(2010) (“Psychological evidence suggests that when individuals consider themselves to be in
certain kinds of reciprocal transactions, they are offended at a perceived downgrading or
commoditizing of the relationship.”); Wilkinson-Ryan & Baron, supra note 7, at 420–21 (finding
that the majority of participants in an experiment believed the promisor should perform rather
than pay damages, that the court should order specific performance and not damages, and that
even super-compensatory damages were inferior to performance).

VII. IMPLEMENTING SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE: PITFALLS AND OBSTACLES
What happens after a specific performance judgment is entered?
Surprisingly, we do not have systematic research data to answer this question.
Instead, reading the literature, one may get the impression that specific
performance judgments lead to more or less the same kind of result as was
promised in the original contract (i.e., performance), and issues relating to
implementation are only relevant in exceptional cases. This leads to the view
that the value to the promisee from a specific performance decree should be
greater than the value of expectation damages, given the known limitations on
the scope of these damages and how they systematically undercompensate
relative to actual profit expectations.123
Indeed, the law itself takes the view that specific performance has a
comparative advantage in terms of compensation. Under the Uniform
Commercial Code, specific performance is to be awarded “where the goods are
unique or in other proper circumstances.”124 The reason is that, in all non-
unique goods cases, damages are seen as providing “adequate” compensation,
and it is only in cases of unique goods or special circumstances that damages
are inadequate and specific performance is called for, under the theory that it
would provide a more adequate compensation.125 The Restatement echoes this
position.126

right [i.e., specific performance] has as much power as a promisee who can enforce a very large
transfer term [i.e., money damages]. In both cases, the promisee can impose heavy costs on a
promisor who refuses to trade or to pay.”); Melvin A. Eisenberg, Actual and Virtual Specific

2015] CONTRACT REMEDIES IN ACTION 397
The findings challenge this view because the implementation of
specific performance decrees is fraught with difficulties that decrease their
value. In general, most interviewees held negative opinions about the
effectiveness of specific performance awards. Only a few interviewees
responded positively and said that their experiences with specific performances
resulted in a timely and quality implementation.127 The majority, however,
faced difficulties in enforcing their judgment and, in some cases, it was never
fully implemented.128 The difficulties, presently described, suggest that in many
cases, specific performance would tend to be under-compensatory, relative to
both performance and expectation damages, thus making it not in the best
interests of the promisee in all cases.
Before describing these difficulties, let us first make explicit an oft-
neglected issue. It is well known that ordinary contracts are sometimes under-
performed (e.g., a plumber installs sub-standard pipes in the hope the
homeowner will not notice).129 Therefore, when we want to measure the value
of specific performance versus the ordinary performance of the contract, our
expectation should not be full and complete performance of the contract, for the
same powers and incentives that operate in the absence of judicial intervention
are likely to persist when a court steps in. What may reduce the value of
specific performance is, potentially, the cost of performance (the fact of breach
indicates that performance became more costly than anticipated, making the
promisor more likely to “cut corners”), and animosity between the parties
following litigation, which may make the promisor spiteful towards the
promisee. Importantly, the value of expectation damages, while under-
compensatory in many regards, is overly compensatory in that it assumes full
and complete performance, thus making it more likely to offer higher
compensation to the promisee than specific performance. 130

398 WEST VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 118
The rest of this Part details the reasons that affect the implementation
of specific performance decrees in cases where the promisor sought to breach
the contract, because presumably performance was costly or difficult.
A. Animosity
As just noted, a primary reason for why we would expect a specific
performance judgment to be of lower value than actual performance is
animosity of the parties, which could lead to spite.131 But some of the findings
contradict either the existence of animosity or its practical importance.
In one of the cases, there was a dispute concerning the implementation
of a multi-million dollar finance agreement. The plaintiff sued and demanded
that the defendant, a bank, specifically perform it. The bank responded that the
deterioration of the parties’ relationships had made it impossible to continue
with the agreement, which required frequent interactions and adjustments. In
litigation the plaintiff prevailed, and in the interview the CEO of the plaintiff
was surprised when asked about the animosity with the bank. The CEO said
that he “knows a different bank than the one described in the judgment” and
that “de-facto, the relationship with the bank is excellent.” When pressed about
the cooperation with the bank and asked about its good will in case of need, he
said that on a daily basis consensual modifications to the agreements took
place, and that the cooperation with the bank is strong.132 A similar finding was
noted with respect to a consumer who ordered a custom-made entrance door to
her house from a small company that manufacturers such doors. The company
delivered a door that opens in the opposite direction to what was ordered, and
refused to offer a replacement. The plaintiff sued, won a specific performance
judgment, and the door was eventually delivered and installed—to the letter of
the judgment.133
These findings suggest that the role of animosity and spite can be easily
exaggerated, and in reality, the same drivers that would ensure performance in
the ordinary run of things would continue to hold even in contexts where a
judgment was rendered. Another potential characterization of these findings is
reflect emotional “disturbance”); Eisenberg, supra note 123, at 989–96; Schwartz, supra note 39,
at 276.
131 See Anthony T. Kronman, Paternalism and the Law of Contracts, 92 YALE L.J. 763, 783
(1983) (“If . . . the promisor is required to perform as he had originally agreed . . . his feelings of
regret are likely to be intensified, particularly when performance entails some ongoing personal
cooperation with the other party or subjection to his personal supervision.”).

that, in cases of parties which are businesses or firms, spite and animosity are
of lesser concern.134
B. Costly Supervision and Lack of Standards
The effectiveness of specific performance judgments depends, in part,
on the ability to verify the quality of performance and to punish deviations. The
common mechanism one finds in the literature is the on-going supervision of
performance (e.g., having a court bailiff monitor the plumber). This mechanism
is often criticized for its costliness. But an alternative approach is much
cheaper—verifying the quality of the finished product.135 If the promisor fails
to meet a given quality standard, the court can either order a full remake or the
modification of the non-conforming part.
The interviews provide an example of the effectiveness of this latter
approach. In the “wrong way door” case mentioned above,136 a lawsuit was
brought against a seller of designer doors who failed to provide the buyer with
a door that matched the buyer’s specifications. The specific performance decree
was effectively enforced without need of judicial supervision, despite the door
being non-standard, due to the existence of detailed product specification in the
order form.137
However, both of these mechanisms are inadequate when it is both
difficult to monitor performance and there is no clear standard for evaluating
the quality of the completed good or service. The latter problem may arise
when performance efforts are only weakly correlated with the quality of the
finished good or when the good has no close substitutes against which it could
be compared. This means that the uniqueness of the good—which is the initial
motivation to abandon expectation damages in favor of specific performance—
also provides a strong reason why specific performance may be ineffective and
therefore under-compensatory.138
Besides these two potential means for enforcement, there is a third
option that could overcome some of the problems just mentioned—the
134 The Restatement notes that “[e]xperience has shown that potential difficulties in
enforcement or supervision are not always realized and the significance of this factor is
peculiarly one for judicial discretion.” RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 366 cmt. a. (AM.
LAW INST. 1981).
135 See Shavell, supra note 11, at 845 (“To enforce specific performance, the court must
ensure that the stipulated performance is accomplished, meaning that the court must be able to
ascertain the quality of performance to guard against its being inadequate.”).
136 See supra note 133 and accompanying text.
137 Madar, Interview, supra note 127.
138 Melvin Eisenberg proposes that difficulty in the verification of quality may actually give
the promisee too much, as he could “opportunistically insist on a gold-plated performance,
threatening that if the performance is anything less, he will go back to the court for an order of
contempt.” See Eisenberg, supra note 123, at 1026.

appointment of a receiver over the promisor’s business. This is a useful method
even when the performance requires special expertise, since the receiver can
(sometimes) effectively direct the employees to employ their know-how. One
case analyzed involved this mechanism and it proved highly effective.139 There
are costs to this mechanism, but at least part of the appeal is that the receiver’s
salary is paid for by the defendant. Further analysis of this mechanism is
required.
C. Post-Judgment Costs and Liquidity
The law and parts of the legal literature recognize that there may be ex-
post costs of implementing the judgment and that these costs may be
substantial, but they focus on the burden to the court and the public purse.140 In
practice, however, the plaintiff is expected to bear costs after the judgment
relating to the enforcement of the judgment, and these are often higher under
specific performance than under expectation damages.
The interviews revealed that all successful collection attempts were
preceded by a plaintiff’s active approach to the defendant; and in the one case
where no action was taken by the plaintiff, the order was not performed.141
Indeed, formally, the plaintiff is not obligated to take any action after a
judgment is issued and the defendant will not be excused from her obligation to
perform just because the plaintiff failed to take action. However, in practice, if
the plaintiff is passive, the prospects of performance appear to be low.
Taking the requisite actions is costly for the plaintiff: coordination of
performance, and its administration and monitoring, requires time and money,
and importantly, tend to be more costly than an award of damages. Note that
while an extensive and broad industry exists for the enforcement of money
judgments and debts, none exists for the enforcement of specific relief.142
Given that the plaintiff’s liquidity may be jeopardized following costly
litigation, the costliness of enforcement can hamper the effectiveness of the
judgment. Note that even a fully rational plaintiff may fail to predict the full
costs of litigation and her financial solvency at the end of litigation, thus
making it possible that the judgment will not be realized. One such example is

court should then balance the cost to the promisee of receiving money damages in the place of
performance against costs of judicial supervision.”).

a woman who filed a suit for specific performance of a promise to allot her a
parking space next to her home. After the judgment was delivered, she became
gravely ill and took no action to collect the judgment. Six years after the fact,
the judgment had still not been performed.143
D. Capitalization and the Judgment-Proof Problem
When the defendant’s wealth is low, theory has it that specific
performance will have an advantage over expectation damages, for the
defendant will be unable to repay the debt in full but could perform instead.144
The problem with this argument is that it does not fully consider the
mechanisms of enforcement. The main mode of enforcement of a specific
performance decree is through the threat of contempt of court.145 With
contempt, the court may impose either financial or criminal sanctions. But in
practice, courts are highly reluctant to jail those who do not meet contractual
obligations. This leaves only the threat of financial sanctions, but in cases of
low capitalization, this threat is obviously of limited value. Consequently, one
of the interviewees, a lawyer, called those defendants with low capitalization
“outlaws” in the literal sense of the word—as they are outside the law’s
ambit.146 In summary, the added value of specific performance over expectation
damages in cases of low financial exposure is likely to be small, if any.
E. Defendant’s Reputation
Besides financial capital, defendants may also have capital in the form
of reputation, which can be leveraged to enforce specific performance
judgments. This is useful because, as just noted, financial and criminal
sanctions are likely to be ineffective in cases of low capitalization, thus making
specific performance only marginally more enforceable than expectation
damages. Moreover, just as reputation concerns reduce the need for costly

performance over expectation damages: “Even if damages are adequate in other respects, they
will be inadequate if they cannot be collected by judgment and execution.” RESTATEMENT

contract.”); Shavell, supra note 11, at 855–56 (arguing that specific performance has an

performance monitoring in ordinary contracts, they will mitigate the need for
judicial supervision of the performance of the judgment.147
Many of the lawyers interviewed stressed this point, and indeed,
instances of successful performance were typified by the debtor having a strong
reputation.148 Consistent with this point, it was noted that having low reputation
concerns often leads to difficulty in enforcing decrees.149
These findings are consistent with similar findings in previous works
that also asserted that businessmen are highly sensitive to considerations of
reputation when choosing business partners,150 and that the reputation
mechanism may altogether substitute the need for the legal system in several
areas.151 Interestingly, in the cases analyzed, reputation did not have sufficient
force to preclude the breach from taking place, but was strong enough to ensure
obedience to the court order. This fact reinforces the notion that reputation is a
complex and nuanced concept that cannot be simply reduced to whether it
exists or not.152
F. Social Norms and Social Pressures
The final source of leverage is social pressure deriving from social
norms. In some settings, the defendant operates in a social environment where
norms may either encourage or discourage compliance with the judgment. As
the following example illustrates, the effects of social powers are complex and
context-dependent.
Mr. Negev was a member of a Moshav, an agricultural village
cooperative, who entered into an agreement with the Moshav that would
transfer his title in his house in exchange for debts owed to the Moshav.153
Negev did not uphold his end of the bargain, and the cooperative brought suit
for specific performance and prevailed. But Negev did not obey the judgment

either. At first, social pressures were such that he said he felt shame and guilt.
But as time passed, it turned out that he was not alone, and other Moshav
members had joined his position after having accumulated debts to the
cooperative. At this stage, “[t]he Cooperative was divided,” he explained,
“between the good and the bad people.”154 He added that, “When I was alone, I
was ashamed, but when other members joined I drew strength.” 155 At this
stage, Negev felt more secure in his position and held firm, until five years later
when a settlement offer was made by the cooperative, and the parties settled for
about half of the original debt.
This example suggests that social pressures can affect the likelihood of
implementation, but that their effect is complex and may work in different
directions, sometimes simultaneously. Therefore, social norms can be a
valuable force but should not be blindly trusted to facilitate enforcement, even
in those cases where social norms are of relevance.
VII. IMPLICATIONS FOR LAW AND THEORY
The preceding Parts have shown some of the unintended and under-
studied functions of specific performance based on the experiences of parties to
specific performance litigation. This Part explores the implications of these
findings to prevailing contract theories, and explains how studying the
phenomena described could challenge, enrich, and deepen different analytic
approaches. As in the theoretical introduction in Part II, this Part divides the
discussion into rights-based and consequentialist theories. It also includes a
discussion of some of the potential legal ramifications for current American
doctrine.
A. Rights-Based Theories of Contract
The relationship between rights-based theories and any kind of
empirical findings is not straightforward, given that many deontological claims
are deduced from a-priori principles.156 Having said that, when deontological
theories are applied to the law, they seem to be at least somewhat concerned
with the consequences of specific legal rules, even if these consequences are
measured solely in terms that are not conventionally understood as
consequentialist: enhancement (or reduction) of autonomy, self-determination,
freedom, etc., as opposed to the more explicit standard of social welfare in
economic analysis.157

404 WEST VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 118
The first implication of this study for rights-based theories is that
instrumental use of specific performance decrees is a common motive, at least
in the sample analyzed. That is, plaintiffs sue for specific performance not only
because they perceive themselves as disappointed victims of a broken promise,
but also employ more sophisticated and calculated approaches than implicitly
assumed by these theories. Plaintiffs sometimes sue for specific performance
because they seek to hold-up the promisor, to signal intentions to the court, or
to accelerate the resolution of their case at a lower cost. And if promisees act
instrumentally and not for performance’s sake, it is no longer clear that the
breach of a promise should entail a right to any of these things; if one was
promised a table, then why would that imply that I have the right, in the case of
default, to receive through hold-up more than the value of the table?
To this, the deontologist may have two responses that are worth noting.
First, deontological analysis is justified in glossing over these instrumental uses
because they are morally impressible (even the term “hold-up” suggests moral
condemnation).158 It would be wrong of the promisee to use the remedy in this
fashion, and so, this impressible use should not affect the desirability of
specific performance. The second response is that such instrumental uses are
unavoidable by-products of an otherwise justified rule, and they are marginal
enough to be dismissed.
These deontological responses are inadequate. The first argument
misses the point that a legal right to specific performance is given precisely
because we cannot trust all people to do the (arguably) morally required
thing.159 There is no right of action against hold-up by the plaintiff. The second
response is only correct if one is determinedly indifferent to the consequences
of legal rights. If, as most deontologist contend, consequences have some
weight, then allowing these by-products can only be justified on the basis that
their frequency is low. Such an assumption is empirical; the evidence gathered
in this study, although partial, suggests that they are relatively frequent, but of
course, further investigation is necessary.
The second implication concerns the under-compensatory nature of
specific performance. As we have seen, some versions of rights-based
arguments advocate specific performance because expectation damages may
not fully compensate the victim due to evidentiary and doctrinal reasons.160
158 For stronger language, see Eisenberg, supra note 123, at 1025 (“[A] promisee may sue for
specific performance opportunistically, because specific performance offers the potential for a
kind of extortion.”).
159 As I mention in the text around note 26, accounts such as Shiffrin’s are concerned with the
environment that the law creates and whether it fosters virtuous choices by moral agents. See
supra text accompanying note 38. The discussion here raises concerns that awarding specific
performance may indeed foster unethical conditions.
160 See supra note 130 and accompanying text.
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1641438
2015] CONTRACT REMEDIES IN ACTION 405
These approaches assume that specific performance is indeed compensatory.161
However, as this Article’s analysis shows, this is often not the case: because
enforcement is costly to police, promisors may be resistant to financial
sanctions, and promisees may lack the necessary liquidity to enforce their
claims. Even more important, specific performance will sometimes be under-
compensatory even relative to expectation damages, so a promisee may find
herself in a worse position with a specific performance judgment than with
expectation damages.
From a theoretical perspective, this suggests that if full compensation is
the goal, the promisee must at least be entitled to choose between expectation
damages and specific performance. But this solution, as will now be explained,
is far from being adequate. Alternatively, it may be that a combination of
specific performance and damages should be awarded more routinely.162 In any
event, rights-based theories should carefully reconsider making specific
performance categorically more available than expectation damages.
Alternatively, if the main purpose of specific performance is not compensation
but rather retribution for the moral wrong of breach, then the case for
expectation damages becomes even stronger, as that remedy is likely to exact a
higher punishment on the promisee.
The third implication concerns the question of whether specific
performance should be optional or a sole remedy. Because specific
performance is sometimes under-compensatory relative to expectation
damages, offering a choice would best protect promisees. However, theories
that hold that the goal of remedies is to hold promisors to their promises would
have hard time justifying the grant of an option besides specific performance.
And so these theories may make both promisees and promisors worse-off—an
unappealing feature.
Even for the theories that seek to compensate promisees, the fact that
introducing a choice leads to strategic effects should be of concern. If allowing
promisees choice can make them worse off due to signaling, the existence of a
choice can be sometimes detrimental.163 Similarly, attorneys may abuse this
161 A prime example of this notion is the following: “Because the normative goal of contract
remedies is compensation, specific performance should lie unless it can be shown that the costs
of specific performance would exceed the gains.” Schwartz, supra note 39, at 294; see also
Linzer, supra note 54, at 137.
162 The Restatement allows the judge to add damages to a specific performance decree. See
RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 345 cmt. a. (AM. LAW INST. 1981) (“Nor are the
remedies listed mutually exclusive, since a court may in the same action, for example, both
require specific performance of a promise and award a sum of money as damages for delay in its
performance.”).
163 See discussion supra Part V.B.1.

406 WEST VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 118
choice to sway their clients to sue for expectation damages even if it reduces
the client’s expected recovery, because it better protects attorneys’ interests.164
In conclusion, then, these implications suggest a necessary
modification of rights-based theories, to account for the fact that a grant of a
legal right to specific performance may produce unintended moral and
economic consequences. Specific performance and actual performance diverge
significantly, either because the promisee uses the judgment to obtain ends
other than performance or because enforcement problems render the value of
the judgment below that of performance. Rights-based theories should account
explicitly for this divergence.165
B. Economic Theories
For economic theories, the importance of empirical findings is much
more salient than it is for rights-based theories. For the economist, and the
consequentialist more generally, the success of a given policy prescription is to
be judged solely by its consequences, so it is vital to match assumptions with
actual practice. This Section focuses on the four major implications of the
Article’s finding for economic theories.
The first implication concerns the value of specific performance.
Economic theory often proceeds under the assumption that specific
performance would lead to a transfer of value equal to or greater than that of
performance by the promisor to the promisee. Either the promisor performs or
the deal is renegotiated under the threat of enforcement, in which case the
promisee can extract high payments from the promisor (the fact of breach
indicates high performance costs).166
The primary finding is the weakness of enforcement mechanisms that
deal with specific relief. Ordering specific performance is not the same as
actual performance. Nor does it result in compensation that is systematically
higher than expectation damages. Unlike damages, the enforcement of specific
relief requires expertise that is lacking in a system that is mostly geared
towards the enforcement of pecuniary obligations. This problem is especially
acute in cases when unique goods are involved, when either the plaintiff or
defendant has low wealth, or when reputation and social norms are not strong
164 See discussion supra Part V.B.2.
165 As noted, most theorists express some general awareness of the problems of enforcement,
and a few mention in passing instrumental uses; however, the systematic divergence of
performance and specific performance has not been fully accounted for.
166 Richard A. Posner, Let Us Never Blame a Contract Breaker, 107 MICH. L. REV. 1349,
1353 (2009) (“In the usual case of breach of contract the cost of performance to the defendant
would exceed the benefit to the plaintiff.”).

2015] CONTRACT REMEDIES IN ACTION 407
motivators. Consequently, specific performance decrees would under-deter
promisors from engaging in inefficient breaches.167
Theorists should be careful when they consider specific performance to
be similar to money damages, due to the important differences in enforcement.
Hence, one should approach with caution a statement such as “[s]pecific
performance is analogous to a punitive sanction that seeks to deter breach
absolutely,”168 as it may well be the case that punitive (or even expectation)
damages would be far more effective than specific performance.
Aside from deterrence, specific performance is also sometimes justified
on the basis of providing insurance for the subjective value the promisee
attaches to performance, and the same problem would be relevant here as
well.169 Therefore, both from deterrence and risk-aversion perspectives, the
under-compensatory nature of specific performance should be a concern.
The second issue of concern is the unwillingness to negotiate, which
was suggested to be partially motivated by animosity, endowment effects, and a
“commensurability bias.” Theory supposes that trade will occur unless
transaction costs are high. But in the contractual settings, negotiation costs are
typically expected to be low, as the parties already know each other and have a
history of negotiation. So we would expect very high rates of PJR. But these
issues, and especially the commensurability bias, may prevent negotiations
even in instances of low transaction costs. Specific performance decrees may
be “stickier” than originally supposed and consequently, they may lead to
inefficiencies if wrongly assigned. This suggests a greater role for expectation
damages or greater attention by judges when they award specific performance.
The third implication relates to the effects of the choice between
damages and specific performance on litigation dynamics.170 As discussed,
affording the plaintiff a choice among remedies has unintended consequences.
Judges may be led to see promisors deviating from the default remedy of
specific performance as signaling their lack of interest in the contract, which
may bolster an excuse by the defendant that the plaintiff is acting
opportunistically. Knowing that, plaintiffs may feel compelled to sue for
specific performance even when expectation damages would be more valuable
for them. Thus the introduction of the choice may be against the interest of

plaintiffs and will lead to an overall excessive number of specific performance
suits. In a different direction is the effect of this choice on lawyers, who may
try to steer the plaintiff into suing for expectation damages to guarantee their
fees and simplify calculation. Overall, introducing a choice has complex
effects, and its desirability should be analyzed within this more holistic view.
A fourth implication concerns the possible effects of routinely granting
specific performance. One might worry that doing so will lead to a flood of
litigation or to a rise in specific performance suits that would require substantial
court supervision. However, as was discussed in Part V.A, even in a
jurisdiction where specific performance is the default remedy, specific
performance suits are not common. Given similar findings from other civil law
countries,171 such concerns should be qualified.
A final point is that the difficulties identified in the enforcement of
specific performance decrees could be useful in further refining the domains in
which specific performance is likely to be preferable to expectation damages.
For example, specific performance could be granted or should be advocated
only in cases where clear standards exist to evaluate performance. 172
C. Legal Implications
There are also a few potential implications that relate to legal policy
and judicial decision-making. The first, and probably most important, is the
appreciation of the frailty of enforcement of specific performance decrees.
While it was expected in the theoretical literature that specific performance will
be difficult to enforce, this Article demonstrates this claim empirically and
highlights the importance of robust enforcement mechanisms. It follows from
the difficulties identified here that enhancing the effectiveness of specific
performance is going to be difficult, unless criminal sanctions will be allowed
(with all the moral and economic costs involved, and especially the costs of
legal errors that would inevitably ensue, leading to incarcerating the innocent).
Another option is to adopt a more liberal approach towards financial sanctions
and the appointing receivers. This will not solve the problem but might mitigate
several instances of it.
A related point concerns the circumstances under which specific
performance should be made available. Under current American law, specific
performance is most commonly available when the subject matter of the
contract is unique (e.g., custom made air pollution unit).173 However, in exactly
171 See Lando & Rose, supra note 84, at 486.
172 Steven Shavell has offered a first general refinement—a distinction between contracts to
produce and contracts to convey property. See Shavell, supra note 11, at 846. This very general
approach is useful but could potentially be narrowed down to allow for further categorization.

(ordering specific performance).

these circumstances, it will be harder to judge the quality of performance by
comparing it with established standards. This challenges the idea that with
unique goods, specific performance most adequately compensates the
promisee. A judge seeking to compensate the promisee to the extent of her lost
value should comparatively assess the desirability of expectation damages and
specific performance in light of the specific circumstances of the case, factoring
in the ability to effectively discern sub-standard performance. Another issue is
that specific performance judgments are not a silver bullet against a defendant’s
insolvency. While section 360 of the Restatement provides that specific
performance would be adequate if “an award of damages could not be
collected,” it is unlikely that in the same circumstances specific performance
would be effective.
And since both remedies are likely to result in some form of under-
compensation in many cases, judges could correct for that by allowing
deficiency judgments, passing the costs of enforcement to the promisor, and
using other similar mechanisms that increase the promisee’s payoff.174 Another
option to ensure that specific performance decrees are effective is to create a
venue for the plaintiff to inexpensively complain about the low-quality
performance of the decree and to set adequate sanctions for sub-standard
performance. By creating such a venue, specific performance will become
much more effective. Such a venue could be implemented by outsourcing the
judicial work of supervision to an arbitrator or receiver, potentially at the
promisor’s expense.
Judges should also not trust plaintiffs to choose the best compensatory
remedy, as was already noted—due to the lawyer’s conflict of interest and
signaling motives. These two reasons, it should be noted, push in opposing
directions. Judges could correct for that, if it is believed necessary, by
employing judicial discretion in the award of remedies, using the broad latitude
provided by law.175
The change of preferences over time poses a difficult hurdle to
plaintiffs, and policy makers should be aware of this difficulty. If the goal is to
enhance the availability of specific performance, attention must be given to the
length of resolution of such cases and their priority in the system.176 This
174 Judges have broad latitude in the design of the specific performance remedy.
RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 358(1) (AM. LAW INST. 1981) (“An order of specific
performance . . . will be so drawn as best to effectuate the purposes for which the contract was
made and on such terms as justice requires. It need not be absolute in form and the performance
that it requires need not be identical with that due under the contract.”).
175 For example, RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 360(a) and § 364(1) (AM. LAW
INST. 1981), allow judges discretion to decide whether damages would be adequate based on “the
difficulty of proving damages with reasonable certainty” and allow the judge to over-ride specific
performance “if such relief would be unfair.”
176 This may lead to prolonging the time to resolve damage suits, but this problem can be
solved by pegging the sum of damages to a relevant price index.

problem could be mitigated by the use of interim remedies, but these types of
solutions should be examined in greater depth.
Finally, it is also important to recognize the lawyers’ agency problem
when they counsel their client on the choice of remedies. It should be
understood that they face a conflict of interest in this situation because a
damages suit will increase their remuneration potential. This agency problem
should be addressed, possibly by rules of professional ethics, to sanction them
for giving self-interested advice to their clients in this context.
X. CONCLUSION
This Article employs qualitative methodology to study contractual
practices “from the inside,” tracking the internal point of view of litigants and
their lawyers. The engagement with litigants has shown that contracting
practices are more complex and nuanced than conceptualized by prevailing
theories. Parties act and respond to myriad background incentives and
limitations, and the ways in which they employ and respond to various
remedies have various unintended consequences.
This approach has illuminated theoretical oversights and suggests
possibilities for future legal and theoretical revisions. However, this study is by
no means conclusive or exhaustive. The limited sample of interviewees and the
complexity of the issue require much more data before definitive measures
could be prescribed. It is hoped that this Article’s discussion paves the way for
a more focused analysis of the many issues presented. Specifically, it would be
useful for a larger sample to be gathered, potentially also including recipients
of money damages, a greater number of parties who have lost in litigation, and
both individuals and parties representing large and small corporations. It is also
hoped that the third generation discourse on specific performance will be
influenced by the empirical aspects of this issue and the findings discussed
here. Without the empirical elements and the sensitivity to the context, the
theoretical debate is bound to remain an intellectual exercise.
