  "abstract": "This Article introduces the “generative reasonable person,” an LLM-based method for estimating how ordinary people judge reasonableness. Using Silicon Randomized Controlled Trials (S-RCTs), it replicates three published studies across negligence, consent under deception, and contract interpretation with nearly 10,000 simulated decisions. Models reproduce subtle, counterintuitive lay patterns that diverge from doctrinal expectations (e.g., social conformity over cost–benefit analysis in negligence; essential lies undermining consent more than material lies; and lay contract formalism regarding hidden fees). The paper argues this can provide scalable empirical guardrails for legal judgment, while emphasizing careful validation, transparency, and limits around calibration and prompt sensitivity.",
