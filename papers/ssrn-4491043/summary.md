    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that large language models (LLMs) as 'smart readers' can markedly reduce contract length and reading time, improving readability to a fifth-grade level without significant loss of essential information. However, he cautions that these tools are not flawless, sometimes miscommunicating legal terms or presenting errors. Thus, while they cannot replace lawyers, smart readers are effective for many daily transactions and signal a crucial need for a paradigm change in how contracts are approached.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his paper investigates the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address the pervasive "no-reading problem" by simplifying complex contractual texts. The study assesses the effectiveness of this simplification through metrics such as text length, complexity, and readability, and also critically evaluates the quality of these simplifications by analyzing specific clauses from major companies like the Wall Street Journal, Airbnb, and Amazon.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a central challenge in consumer contracts is the "no-reading problem," where consumers' failure to engage with standard forms undermines informed decision-making and reduces sellers' incentives for fair terms. He explains that this chapter evaluates whether "smart readers," technological tools employing large language models, can effectively address this issue by simplifying contractual texts, thereby testing if current models have already achieved a utility threshold sufficient to empower consumers.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his study examines how "smart readers" utilizing LLMs perform in simplifying legal documents by comparing complexity, length, readability, and quality before and after simplification, analyzing both entire agreements and specific clauses to tackle the "no-reading problem." He notes that while these smart readers significantly improve text difficulty and length and generally capture important aspects, they can struggle with certain clauses—sometimes understating, omitting, or providing incorrect information. Thus, they do not replace lawyers but offer a scalable solution for consumers.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that consumers often avoid reading form contracts because they are cognitively taxing and visually difficult, a situation that allows firms to implement a "HIDE" strategy using terms that are "Hardly Interpretable but Dependably Enforceable." He notes that in response, courts have sometimes imposed a "duty to read," while lawmakers have instituted numerous plain language laws aiming to improve contract readability and accessibility, though these traditional measures face challenges.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that current efforts to simplify legal contracts for consumers, such as plain language requirements, often prove inadequate. He argues these methods overlook consumer diversity, the challenges of low literacy, and the persistent issue of excessive contract length. However, the emergence of transformer AI technology, like GPT models, presents a promising new path with 'smart readers' capable of processing and interacting with complex legal texts in previously inconceivable ways, offering a potential solution.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that advanced large language models, or "smart readers," offer significant potential to empower consumers by personalizing and clarifying complex legal texts like contracts, thereby challenging sellers' obscure "HIDE" strategies. He acknowledges that while the technology in 2021 was nascent, unreliable, and met with skepticism, these issues were considered temporary, stemming from data and compute limitations rather than fundamental flaws, with subsequent models demonstrating clear advancements in capability and reliability.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Large Language Models like GPT-4 have demonstrated remarkable capabilities by excelling in complex exams, which has shifted the public's focus from what the technology can do to exploring its limitations, thereby highlighting its significant potential. Given the rapid mass adoption and accessibility of this impressive technology, he asserts it is now timely to assess whether "smart readers" can effectively empower consumers and comprehensively address the widespread "no-reading problem" concerning contracts and policies.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that their examination of consumer contracts, including those from major companies like Netflix and Google, focuses on readability using tests such as Flesch Ease of Reading to explore if language models can make these documents more comprehensible. He also points out that these traditional readability tests, which primarily assess syntactic features like sentence length and word rarity, are critiqued for their limited reliability, validity, and high manipulability, suggesting a need for more nuanced evaluation methods.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that their research assesses language models' ability to simplify legal texts based on key criteria: improvements in readability, significant length reduction, and the crucial preservation of essential meaning and context. He explains that to address technical challenges, such as model selection and input length limits, they opted for cost-effective yet competent models like Claude and ChatGPT and also developed their own smart reader to manage these operational constraints effectively.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a critical challenge in their research was devising a specific, iteratively developed prompt for AI models to simplify contracts effectively. This prompt aimed for no information loss, simpler language, and brevity while meticulously preserving necessary legal concepts. Their analysis then proceeded to test the AI's simplification ability using objective metrics like length and readability, and to assess the quality of summaries by their capacity to capture key contractual information accurately.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that their high-level results indicate that various AI models, on average, successfully reduced the word count of contracts to approximately 30% of their original length. He highlights that this substantial reduction in text significantly decreased the estimated reading time for these documents, for example, from an average of 20 minutes and 45 seconds for an original contract down to just 6 minutes and 6 seconds for its AI-simplified version.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that AI models demonstrate significant variability in summarization, producing outputs with widely different lengths and reduction percentages even when given similar prompts, indicating a large degree of inconsistency between them. He notes that beyond aggregated reductions in word count, sentence count, and reading time, another important way to assess the simplification of text is by examining its complexity, for instance, through a systematic count of difficult words within the processed text.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that by using the Dalle-Chall word list, his research found an average 61% reduction in difficult words when comparing original contractual texts to versions processed by various AI models. He further states that beyond merely counting difficult words, the study also comprehensively assessed overall text readability using established measures such as the Flesch-Kincaid score and an average derived from multiple readability assessment tools to provide a broader view of simplification.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that original contracts, typically requiring 10 to 14 years of schooling according to the Flesch-Kincaid measure, saw an average reduction in reading difficulty of 1.47 grade levels when processed by LLMs. He highlights that the best performing model, Claude-001, significantly improved readability, reducing the Flesch-Kincaid level by 5.6 grades to a 5.4 grade level. This makes contracts accessible to 11-year-olds and aligns with expert recommendations for consumer documents.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that despite prompts to simplify contracts, some large language models surprisingly made them more complex, although models like Claude-001 and Text-Davinci-003 showed more consistent success in this task. He adds that his team also subjectively assessed output quality by comparing Spotify's original terms with simplified versions from ChatGPT-Turbo and Claude, specifically looking for whether 11 identified "traps" for unwary consumers were adequately addressed in the simplified outputs.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while both smart reader platforms effectively simplified contracts and captured most important information and identified "traps," they exhibited varied success and omissions. This suggests models could be complementary and that LLMs might systematically miss certain types of information. He notes that current flaws, such as those arising from "chunking" text, are considered transient, and the research subsequently shifted to analyzing specific challenging clauses to develop a more robust understanding of simplification quality.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the research actively selected consumer-relevant contract clauses, such as those concerning unilateral modifications by companies, and utilized GPT-4 to create simplified versions. These simplified versions were then meticulously evaluated for improvements in length, complexity, and the overall quality of simplification. An analysis of a Wall Street Journal clause allowing unilateral changes to its subscriber agreement found GPT-4's simplification to be highly effective in clarifying this term of considerable importance to consumers.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while a simplified contract version is generally true to the original and clearly presents its main point, it may subtly mislead consumers. For instance, it might imply changes are entirely unilateral, contrasting with the original's requirement that changes are only effective if communicated. Despite this, he notes this simplified version demonstrates significant quantitative improvements, reducing text complexity by nearly 7.5 to 8 grade levels to an eighth-grade reading standard, cutting word count by 26%, and decreasing average word length.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the Wall Street Journal's original 'Agreement to Arbitrate' clause stipulates that most controversies or claims, with specific exceptions for intellectual property and small claims court disputes, will be resolved by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association. He further clarifies that by entering into this agreement, individuals effectively waive their right to a jury trial and are explicitly barred from participating in class arbitrations or class actions.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes to present example arbitration clauses, both in standard legal language and a simplified version. These clauses stipulate that most disputes will be resolved through arbitration governed by New York law and the Federal Arbitration Act, thereby waiving jury trials and prohibiting class actions. He further details these clauses, which specify arbitration locations, procedural options for small claims under $14,000, and limitations on the arbitrator's award to individual relief, typically without a statement of reasons unless jointly requested.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while simplifying a mandatory arbitration clause is generally beneficial, the evaluated attempt introduced problems. These included reducing the salience of arbitration, altering the legal meaning of terms like 'intellectual property' and 'equitable relief,' and critically omitting the customer's right to bring complaints to state or federal agencies. Despite these shortcomings, he notes the simplification dramatically reduced reading complexity from a PhD to an eighth-grade level, though effectively translating complex legal terms like 'equitable relief' into simple language remains a pressing dilemma.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that analysis of publications like the Wall Street Journal indicates a trend towards clause simplification and shorter average word lengths in their contractual terms. He also notes that companies like Airbnb outline in their policies how they collect personal information from third-party services, such as linked social media accounts, and also obtain background information or criminal records as permitted by applicable laws, illustrating common data collection practices.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Airbnb details its collection of personal information from various third-party sources, including co-travelers, insurance claims, connected services like Google, and background check providers, and presents a simplified version of this policy section. He observes that this simplification successfully distills the original provision’s complex legal language into more accessible terms for consumers without distorting the overall meaning regarding third-party data collection practices by the company.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while Airbnb's simplified privacy policy offers some clearer phrasing, it problematically omits important details such as the sharing of friend lists. He also notes it can be misleading regarding user consent for background checks and the extent of information sharing with insurers. However, quantitatively, the simplified policy shows substantial improvement, reducing readability from a college level to a sixth or seventh grade level and decreasing the word count by a significant 50%.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while the simplified Netflix cancellation clause generally maintains the original's integrity and improves accessibility, cancellation provisions are inherently tricky in consumer contracts. He points out that this specific simplification, however, contains a critical misinterpretation of the refund policy by omitting the original's qualification that payments are non-refundable only "to the extent permitted by the applicable law," which could consequently mislead consumers about their rights in certain jurisdictions.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Netflix's simplified text erroneously claims an inability to refund payments, a statement that could potentially mislead consumers in jurisdictions where laws may mandate such refunds under certain circumstances. He notes that despite this significant miscommunication regarding refund policies, the simplification still managed to improve readability to a 6th-7th grade level, although with only a modest 16% reduction in word count compared to the original clause.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Amazon's terms permit users to post content like reviews and comments, provided it is not illegal, obscene, or infringing. Amazon reserves the right, but not the obligation, to remove or edit such content without regular review. He further explains that by posting content, users grant Amazon a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, and distribute that content worldwide, and users also warrant ownership and agree to indemnify Amazon for claims arising from their content.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while the evaluated simplification of a contract provision governing user content contribution, like online reviews on Amazon, is largely effective and impressively improves readability, it does omit some important restrictions present in the original text. He highlights a more significant concern: that the simplification, despite communicating most user obligations, might not sufficiently convey the gravity of these potentially burdensome warranties (such as ensuring review accuracy and non-harm) due to its less formal tone.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that dense legal clauses, such as Amazon's "Risk of Loss" terms, can be significantly simplified by using shorter sentences and more straightforward language, as demonstrated by a tangible reduction in average word length in the simplified versions. He illustrates that this simplification effectively transforms complex statements, like Amazon's original risk of loss clause, into much clearer terms such as "When you buy physical items from Amazon, they are yours once we give them to the carrier for delivery."
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while a simplified contract clause regarding delivery risk effectively communicates ownership transfer to the buyer upon shipping, it inadequately conveys that the customer bears the risk if delivery subsequently fails. He notes that this criticism of unclear risk allocation extends to simplified return clauses as well, and observes that while the simplification achieved only modest readability gains for an already relatively simple original clause, more significant improvements could potentially be made.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Yahoo's privacy policy details how user information is shared within its affiliated brands and companies, and also for purposes described in its policy, including the provision of requested services to users. He further notes that Yahoo asserts it does not sell, license, or share information that individually identifies customers with external companies unless specific circumstances apply, such as obtaining user consent, sharing within Yahoo affiliates, or with trusted partners under confidentiality measures.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Yahoo shares aggregated or pseudonymous, non-personally identifiable user information with partners like advertisers and analytics companies, while also sharing information within its own related brands and companies. He clarifies that personally identifiable information is not shared with outside companies unless users give explicit permission, and notes that third-party apps, websites, or advertisers integrated with Yahoo services collect data under their own distinct privacy policies, separate from Yahoo's.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while AI simplification can capture the intended logic of complex legal provisions, such as Yahoo's policies on information sharing, its value is inherently limited if the original legal documents are poorly drafted or contain logical inconsistencies. Despite these limitations, he finds that AI simplification proved helpful by dramatically reducing text complexity and improving readability, though he cautions that firms might adopt specific drafting strategies to circumvent the effectiveness of smart readers.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Spotify's terms state a user's sole remedy for dissatisfaction with its service or any linked third-party applications is to uninstall the service and cease using them. He further explains that Spotify also disclaims liability for various types of damages, capping its aggregate liability for all claims related to the service at the greater of the amounts paid by the user in the prior twelve months or a nominal sum of $30.00.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Spotify's terms attempt to significantly limit its liability, for instance by stating the user's sole remedy for issues is to stop using the service and by capping potential monetary damages at recent payments or $30. He observes that these liability limitation clauses, while common in consumer contracts, are worded inconsistently and confusingly within Spotify's terms, initially offering uninstallation as the only remedy before then moving to limit monetary damages.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while a simplification of Spotify's disclaimer had some communicative benefits for consumers, it problematically altered the legal meaning of the clause. This was achieved by replacing specific legal terms with simpler but inexact phrases. Quantitatively, he notes this simplification improved readability scores but also slightly increased document length and, importantly, highlighted the limitations of standard readability tests when dealing with complex sentence structures common in legal texts.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that simplified legal clauses demonstrated enhanced accessibility through notably shorter length, reduced complexity, and significantly improved readability metrics, on average halving the required education level for comprehension. However, he cautions that despite these substantial gains, simplified texts might still be inaccessible by standard metrics and offer no guarantee that consumers will actually read them, though an overall significant improvement in understandability was observed across the board.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while smart readers made contracts more accessible with simpler language, their accuracy was mixed; some simplifications were beneficial, but others introduced substantial issues such as suggesting non-existent active consent requirements or omitting crucial consumer rights. A significant observed problem was the incorrect usage of legal terminology, like confusing "consequential" with "follow-on" damages, which could be harmful if courts adopt the smart reader's potentially flawed interpretation over the canonical contract.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that smart readers can substantially shorten legal texts, reduce their complexity, and improve overall readability, generally including important information in their summaries. He concludes that while not perfect, these simplification tools offer a marked improvement over the common scenario of consumers not reading legal texts at all, potentially facilitating more informed decisions and thereby enhancing market efficiency by better aligning consumer understanding with contractual obligations.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that current smart reader models, though not yet replacements for lawyers, have effectively arrived and can serve as a cheap, effective, and scalable alternative for the many contracts and privacy policies that presently go unread by consumers. He states that despite their revolutionary potential to transform consumer contracting, concerns regarding accuracy, corporate capture, and bias must be diligently addressed, as their materializing potential would make a law and policy paradigm shift appropriate, if not inevitable.
