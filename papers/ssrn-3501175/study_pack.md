## Elevator pitch

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that a small group of hyper-persistent consumers, dubbed "nudniks," play a crucial role in market discipline by actively challenging seller misconduct, benefiting all consumers. However, sellers increasingly use big data to identify and neutralize these nudniks, undermining accountability. Arbel calls for legal strategies to protect this vital "nudnik-based activism" and preserve its positive spillovers, shifting focus from mythical contract-readers to these real-world enforcers of market norms.
