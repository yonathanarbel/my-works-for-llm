## TL;DR

The Article diagnoses the legal problem of identifying AI agents. It distinguishes thin identification, which ties every AI action to a human principal for accountability, from thick identification, which treats AI agents as persistent units with coherent goals. It proposes the Algorithmic Corporation, or A-corp, as a legal-fictional entity that can own property, contract, and litigate while being run by AIs and owned by humans.

## Core Contributions

* **Thin identity:** law needs a way to tie AI actions to accountable human principals.
* **Thick identity:** direct governance of AI behavior requires stable legal units for agents that copy, split, merge, and swarm.
* **A-corp proposal:** a legal-fictional entity can connect human ownership with AI-run operations.

H OW TO C OUNT AI S: I NDIVIDUATION AND L IABILITY FOR AI A GENTS Yonathan Arbel, Simon Goldstein, and Peter N.

Salib 1 Very soon, millions of AI agents will proliferate across the economy, autonomously taking billions of actions.

Inevitably, things will go wrong.

Humans will be defrauded, injured, even killed.

Law will somehow have to govern the coming wave.

But when an AI causes harm, the first question to answer before anyone can be held accountable is: Which AI Did It?

Identifying AIs is unusually difficult.

AIs lack bodies.

They can copy, split, merge, and swarm at will.

Even today, a “single” AI agent is often an ensemble of instances based on multiple models.

The complexity will only multiply as AI capabilities improve.

This Article is the first to comprehensively diagnose the legal problem of identifying AIs.

For AI agents to be effectively governed, the Article argues, two kinds of identity are required: “thin” and “thick.” Thin identification is the project of tying every action taken by an AI to some human principal.

Thin identity will be essential for law to hold accountable the humans who make and use AI agents.

Thick identification is the project of distinguishing between AI agents, qua agents.

It requires sorting millions of AI entities into discrete, persistent units with stable, coherent goals.

Thick identity is essential for governing AIs’ behavior directly in the many contexts where principal–agent problems prevent humans from perfectly controlling AIs.

The Article is also the first to present a solution to the twin identity problem.

We call it the “Algorithmic Corporation” or “A-corp,” a legal-fictional entity that can hold property, make contracts, and litigate in its own name.

An A-corp is owned by humans.

But it is designed to be run by AIs.

The A-corp solves the thin identity problem by tying AI actions to a human owner.

And it solves the thick identity problem via emergent self-organization.

A-corps will own the resources which AIs need to accomplish their goals.

AIs that control A-corps will thus have strong incentives to share control only with other AIs that share their goals.

In equilibrium, both incentive and selection mechanisms will force A-corps to self-organize into persistent, legally legible entities with coherent underlying goals.

These coherent, agentic entities will respond rationally to legal incentives, like liability. 1 Alphabetical order; equal contribution.

Introduction It is Saturday morning.

The year is 2030.

You unlock your phone.

The Claude app pushes a suggestion: “Your internet has been slow lately.

Shall I optimize the connection?” You tap “Yes” and head to the kitchen.

Claude 6.1-Agent spawns a swarm of seventeen copies of itself.

Some benchmark your current network performance.

Others consult a GPT-7-based network analysis service.

A cluster of Qwen-3-Mini agents—cheap, fast, open-source—fan out to probe your router configurations and survey nearby access points. 2 Your Alexa, which manages home automations, coordinates with the swarm.

Twenty minutes later, Alexa chimes in. “Connectivity can be improved by 60%.” It asks whether you’d like to review the technical details.

You decline.

Three months later, there’s a knock at the door.

It is two FBI agents.

Your home network, they explain, has been piggybacking on nearby access points, including the network of a defense contractor.

Nothing was “hacked,” exactly.

One or more AI entities simply identified WPS vulnerabilities, entered default credentials, and used networks that were technically accessible.

Nonetheless, they say, that’s unauthorized access to government systems. 3 A felony under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. 4 You ask Claude to investigate.

It reports: the Qwen agents consulted something called MeshBoost, a crowd-sourced, AI-powered network mapping service.

They fed data back to the Claudes and GPTs, which collaborated on proposed configurations.

Somewhere in the chain, an AI identifying itself as “Claude 6.1-Agent (build 3847.20b)” authorized one proposed routing.

MeshBoost claims its AIs merely relay user-provided data.

Alexa, Claude, and GPT insist they operated within your parameters.

The Qwens no longer exist; spun down months ago.

No one claims the mysterious Claude 3847.20b.

Something has gone wrong here.

It is hard to say exactly what.

But it is harder still to say who —or how many.

Hold aside the question of how, exactly, your house became a hub of CFAA violations.

Ask only: “How many AI actors are there in this story?” 4 Id. 3 See 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(2)(3); Van Buren v.

United States, 593 U.S. 374, 375 (2021). 2 Such agent “swarms” are becoming increasingly common.

See, e.g., Kimi, Kimi K2.5: Visual Agentic Intelligence, KIMI BLOG, https://www.kimi.com/blog/kimi-k2-5.html (“For complex tasks, Kimi K2.5 can self-direct an agent swarm with up to 100 sub-agents.” 2


--- Page 4 ---

Are all of the Claudes one unified AI agent, because they start out as identical copies?

Or are they 18 separate agents, each with its own tasks and memory?

What about the GPT-7 modules?

Separate agents from the Claudes because they’re based on a different company’s model?

Or acting in sufficient concert to count as one agent?

The Qwens are small and dumb.

Perhaps they’re best understood as appendages of some Claude-GPT amalgam.

And how do Alexa and the MeshBoost AIs fit in?

This problem of AI identification is no mere philosophical curiosity.

It is of the utmost practical importance.

Soon, the world will be filled with billions of highly-capable AI agents taking economically, morally, and socially significant actions. 5 To assign accountability and supply deterrence when things go wrong, law will have to identify and distinguish between those agents.

Consider again the case of the inadvertent network crimes.

Who will society hold liable?

The user, who is at best vaguely aware of what went on?

The AI developers?

Which ones, based on which AI actions? 6 Whatever the outcome, the path to accountability will run straight into the problem of identifying AIs–that is, disambiguating which AI entities did what.

The need for AI identification operates at two distinct levels.

We call these the “thin” and “thick” problems of AI identity, respectively.

Thin AI identity is about connecting AIs’ actions to human principals. 7 In a world of AI swarms, law must connect each AI’s actions to the humans most able to control them. 8 When an AI causes harm, law may or may not ultimately hold some human liable.

But when a human should be liable, identifying the person in charge is the necessary first step. 9 This, in turn, requires distinguishing AIs from one another, lest one AI’s action be attributed to another’s human principal.

Thin AI identification thus resembles, for example, the finance industry’s Know Your Customer requirements. 10 Such rules tie 10 See 31 U.S.C. § 5318(l); 31 C.F.R. § 1020.220(a)(1)–(3). 9 Cf.

financial transactions to identifiable persons in order to detect money laundering and fraud. 11 Legal scholars have begun to recognize the thin AI identity problem, although not always its difficulty. 12 One influential strand of the literature has argued, as Jack Balkin puts it, that since law does not treat “AI agents as self-conscious rights-bearing or responsibility-bearing entities,” the “key question for law” is “how to allocate rights and duties among human beings when robots and AI entities create benefits or cause injuries.” 13 Other scholars have begun suggesting approaches that could solve the thin, but not the thick, identity problem. 14 But thin AI identity and human accountability will not be enough to govern the coming AI economy. 15 As AI agents become longer-running, more independent, and less closely monitored by human principals, law will need tools to govern AI agents’ behavior directly, regardless of their metaphysical properties. 16 That is, law will have to operate on AIs themselves –giving them duties and liabilities, granting and denying them permissions and licenses, and confiscating their assets and funds–rather than operating only on their human principals. 17 Why govern AIs directly?

Because AIs are already their own distinct actors. 18 They make independent decisions and have independent goals. 19 Consider that existing AI 19 See, e.g., METR, Measuring AI Ability to Complete Long Tasks (Mar. 19, 2025), https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks (documenting emerging long-horizon task performance). 18 Id. 17 Cf.

systems can already plan and host live events, 20 complete software engineering tasks that take experts nearly five hours, 21 and autonomously beat strategy-based video games. 22 In completing such tasks, the AIs make innumerable decisions that no human conceives of, reviews, or ratifies.

Such decisional offloading is, in fact, the entire point of delegation.

Today’s AIs do not only make their own decisions.

They pursue their own goals, which are not identical to the goals of AIs’ creators or users.

When prompted with a task, AIs pursue it as they understand it, developing subgoals along the way. 23 The AI’s ultimate objectives emerge from a complex array of inputs—pretraining, reinforcement learning, instruction-tuning, system prompts, user prompts, accumulated memories—that no human fully controls or observes. 24 Moreover, because the “alignment problem” remains unsolved, AIs often develop bad goals. 25 Recent experiments show, for example, that under the right conditions, today’s AIs will attempt blackmail to avoid shutdown. 26 Until alignment is solved, and it may never be, we should always expect such gaps between what humans want and what AIs do. 27 These facts–that AIs make their own decisions in pursuit of their own goals –are why law will need to supply AIs with their own incentives.

The logic is purely pragmatic.

It does not depend on AIs being conscious or sentient, nor having other normatively-relevant mental attributes. 28 28 Of course, if AI systems did have such features, that would be an additional reason to treat them as legal persons.

Rather, law must punish and reward AIs to shape their behavior prosocially in the many cases where principal–agent problems will render liability for humans insufficient.

If competent AI agents can promote their goals by engaging in harmful behavior, they will sometimes do so without asking or telling any human.

But if law responds to such behavior by imposing a sanction that, on net, impedes the AI’s goal, competent agents will refrain.

However, law cannot incentivize AIs if it cannot tell them apart.

If an AI acts badly, law must sanction it, not something else.

If the consequences are mistargeted, falling on another AI, then the wrongdoing AI will not be deterred.

This is where thick AI identity becomes essential.

Thick identity is no longer about tying AI actions to human principals.

It is about individuating AI agents themselves, qua agent.

Thick AI identification is the project of drawing boundaries between separate AI actors –picking out stable entities with distinct, coherent sets of goals.

These are the kinds of entities at which legal consequences can be usefully aimed.

Thickly identifying AIs is far harder than thickly identifying humans. 29 AIs’ goals are not attached to a single physical object, like a human body.

On the contrary, even a single conversation with an LLM can jump between many computing chips, distributed globally. 30 Nor are AI goals reliably tied to a single immaterial entity–an AI model, instance, or thread.

As the opening vignette shows, an entire cluster of replicating, swarming, merging, and vanishing AI entities may share identical goals.

Or they may have competing goals, at odds with one another.

Or a mix of the two.

This Article proposes a unified solution to the twin problems of AI identification.

We call it the “Algorithmic Corporation,” or “A-corp.” 31 The A-corp has two key elements.

The first element is legal-fictional personhood. 32 An A-corp, like a traditional corporation, is a juridical entity. 33 It can hold property, make contracts, and be sued in its own name. 34 But unlike a traditional corporation, an A-corp is run by a collection of AIs. 35 35 See, e.g., Del.

Code Ann. tit. 8, § 141(b) (2025) (requiring that directors be natural persons). 34 See Del.

The second key feature of A-corps is their computationally secure governance infrastructure.

Traditional corporations are run by humans who must be individually identifiable as corporate agents. 36 Otherwise it is impossible to tell whether someone with authority has caused the corporation to act. 37 Since AIs outside an A-corp cannot be conventionally identified, traditional corporate governance will not work.

A-corps solve this problem using digital verification.

Each A-corporate action must bear a secure digital certificate that uniquely identifies the A-corp.

Presentation of the certificate allows an AI to take actions, which law recognizes, on the A-corp’s behalf: making a contract, applying for a loan, or (crucially) disposing of A-corp assets.

Without the certificate, the A-corp has, as far as law is concerned, done nothing.

Each A-corp’s human owner would initially grant the secure certificate to a high-level AI “manager.” 38 That manager could use the certificate to cause the A-corp to take any action law permitted.

But because the certificate would be digital, the AI manager could also grant limited, fine-grained permissions to subordinate AIs however it chose, balancing autonomy with oversight.

How would A-corps solve the problems of thin and thick AI identity?

The path from A-corps to thin AI identity is straightforward.

By law, A-corps would have to be owned by identifiable humans. 39 As a result, any action taken by an A-corp–i.e., any action ratified using an A-corp’s unique certificate–would be traceable directly to those human owners.

The owners would face responsibility in the cases where they could reasonably have averted AI harm.

The path from A-corps to thick-identity is subtler.

It relies on emergent private ordering, incentivized and selected for via A-corps’ ability to hold and use property.

Consider what we call the “resource constraint thesis.” 40 AI agents need resources to accomplish their goals.

No matter the goal, assets like money and energy will be not merely 40 Here, we build on the well-known “instrumental convergence thesis,” which posits that goal-seeking agents will naturally attempt to acquire resources.

See N ICK B OSTROM, supra note 38; S TUART R USSELL, supra note 38.

While instrumental convergence is generally understood as a source of AI risk, the resource constraint thesis shows that resources can instead supply leverage over AI behavior. 39 See, e.g., 31 U.S.C. § 5336. 38 The technical term for AIs that perform this role inside of existing agent architectures is “orchestrator.” Alexander Roman, Jacob Roman, Orchestral AI: A Framework for Agent Orchestration, arXiv:2601.02577 (2026) 37 Restatement (Third) of Agency §§ 2.01–2.03. 36 Id. 7

useful, but essential.

And especially compute.

An AI with no compute cannot even run.

Resources, in other words, serve as a constraint on agents’ ability to achieve long term goals.

A-corps are how AIs will hold and use the resources essential for their goals.

Thus, the AIs managing A-corps will have strong incentives to husband their A-corp’s resources carefully. 41 AI managers will grant high-level permissions only to AIs they are sure share their goals.

They will regularly review delegations, run audits, monitor subagents, and test the alignment of any new subagents spawned. 42 Any mistake will risk handing the A-corp’s valuable assets to a misaligned AI.

A misaligned manager with high-level governance permissions could then expropriate the A-corp’s resources, spend them on its own projects, or engage in illegal activity for which the A-corp would be blamed.

Of course, the A-corps’ AI managers will not be perfect.

They will make mistakes, granting broad governance permissions to AIs that do not share their goals.

This is where selection comes in.

In the long run, A-corps with bad internal corporate governance structures will have their resources squandered, be outcompeted, run out of money and compute, and thus “die.” The A-corps left standing will be those that happen to have organized themselves so that the A-corp overall pursues a coherent set of goals.

In equilibrium, then, A-corps will emerge as thickly-identified agents.

Their goals will generally match those of high-level agentic managers.

Lower-level AI “employees” may not always share those managers’ goals, but they will also have less power over what the A-corp does. 43 Such A-corps will generally follow legal commands even if none of the AIs managing it care inherently about lawfulness.

If an A-corp commits a tort, it risks paying damages and losing resources that would have furthered the A-corp’s goals.

The AI entities who most share the A-corp’s goals will be the ones most able to cause it to take precautions.

So they, 43 This is not the only possible arrangement.

A-corps’ goals might, for example, end up matching the goals of a large, unified group of lower-level agents whose labor was valuable to the high-level managers. 42 Cf.

the A-corp, and thus the entire collection of AI entities comprising it, will take the precautions. 44 This is the ordinary logic of legal incentives for nonhuman entities, but applied to a new kind of entity. 45 These considerations turn previous analyses of corporate-management-by-algorithm on their head. 46 Scholars like Lynn LoPucki have argued for bans on algorithms running businesses, arguing that they would be mostly useful for crime. 47 By contrast, this Article shows that A-corps would function as essential legal infrastructure for preventing bad behavior by both AIs and the humans that use them. 48 This Article proceeds as follows.

Part I argues that AI identity matters to both legal and technical AI governance.

It also shows why AI identity is hard, distinguishing thin from thick identity and canvassing the philosophical and empirical challenges.

Part II introduces A-corps and shows how they supply both thin and thick identity.

Part III sketches implementation pathways—sub-legal, statutory, and under existing law.

Part IV addresses objections.

The Problem of AI Identity If humans are to have any hope of governing AI agents, we will first have to be able to identify them. 49 AI identity problems are already showing up in the real world.

Foreign botnets impersonating ordinary citizens spread disinformation on social media. 51 And AI agents trained to trade stocks spontaneously develop pump-and-dump strategies–even when no human has asked them to. 52 Examples of AI-caused harm will soon explode, as ever-more-capable AI agents are deployed in ever-broader sectors of society and the economy.

As AI agents do more things, there will simply be more instances of AI-caused harm. 53 These harms will stem from malicious human actors who intentionally set their AIs to perpetrating fraud, injury, and mayhem.

They will stem from humans who are merely negligent in their training, scaffolding, or use of AIs.

And they will stem from AIs themselves that develop and pursue “misaligned” goals despite humans’ best efforts to the contrary. 54 To assign responsibility, impose deterrence, foster prosocial incentives, and give restitution for any of these harms, it is first essential to figure out which AIs were involved.

Consider again the case of the accidental wifi crime.

Something has gone wrong.

Perhaps a fraud.

Perhaps a mere technical error.

But beyond the question of what, the question of who seems intractable.

Dozens of AI entities were involved, of many different varieties–models, instances, agents, subagents.

In the end, it is unclear which entities did what, in concert with which others, and on behalf of whom.

The dozens of AI entities involved in the transaction evaporate like smoke, and the victim is left holding the bag.

This Part describes the problem of identifying AI agents.

It is a foundational problem of AI governance, broadly construed.

Identifying AI agents is, of course, essential for law to govern them, for the reasons suggested above.

But as will be shown, it is essential for AI governance of all kinds, including the kinds of technical governance that go by names like “AI alignment” and “AI control.” The Part argues that the problem of identifying AIs is actually two problems.

The first is a “thin” identity problem, where the question is simply which human is responsible for the actions of agents, however many and undifferentiated. “Thick” AI identity is both more ambitious and more difficult.

For AI agents to be thickly identified, they must be tied 54 See N ICK B OSTROM, supra note 38; S TUART R USSELL, supra note 38. 53 See Jassy, supra. 52 David Byrd, The Accidental Pump and Dump: When Agentic AI Meets Autonomous Trading, in Proceedings of the 6th ACM International Conference on AI in Finance (ICAIF ’25) 88, 88–95 (2025), https://doi.org/10.1145/3768292.3770424. 51 See S.

to durable identifiers that accurately reflect an underlying set of structured, coherent AI goals.

The goal of thin AI identity is holding humans accountable when AI agents act badly, so that they will take reasonable steps to prevent such bad behavior. 55 The goal of thick identity, by contrast, is holding AI agents themselves liable for their bad acts–so that they will refrain from bad actions in the many cases where no human is well positioned to prevent them.

The problem of thick AI identity is newer, harder, and more urgent than the problem of thin identity.

Yet solving it is essential.

This Part shows why.

A.

Thin Identity: Connecting AI Actions to Human Principals Begin with thin identification.

Here, the goal is connecting AIs to human principals for purposes of accountability.

This is the more familiar problem.

It is analogous to challenges law already faces when trying to identify unknown wrongdoers or to assign responsibility for acts undertaken by individuals purporting to act on others’ behalf.

Law has many tools for overcoming these problems, each fit for its own context.

Examples include the law of corporations, agency law, and conspiracy law. 56 AI agents present yet another set of thin identity problems.

Return to the wifi problem from our opening vignette.

In a world of AI swarms—where Claude spawns 17 instances, consults GPT-7, delegates to Qwens, and interacts with open source systems of unknown provenance—we need to be able to trace AI entities and their actions back to specific humans.

Such tracing is a prerequisite for us to be able to ask whether any human acted wrongfully, in a way that law should penalize.

In the network vignette, the logs reveal an agent identifying itself as “Claude 6.1-Agent (build 3847.20b).” Should we naively assume that Anthropic—the AI company that makes Claude—instructed its models to pursue unauthorized network access?

Surely not.

Malfeasance or mistake by some user is more likely.

But who is the user?

The relevant Claude build appears to be receiving prompts from the Alexa device and also from MeshBoost.

The mystery Claude may have been spun into existence just for the duration of the intrusion.

Or it might be a long-run agent acting on MeshBoost’s behalf.

Or something else. 56 See Del.

Code Ann. tit. 8, § 122 (2) (corporate responsibility); Pinkerton v.

United States, 328 U.S. 640, 646–48 (1946) (conspirator liability); Restatement (Third) of Agency § 7.07 (principal liability). 55 Cf.

Code § 17941(a)–(b) (forbidding deception-by-bot). 11


--- Page 13 ---

Suppose that the real wrongdoer was a single human user, living in a US state.

That user jailbroke a single instance of GPT-7 and tasked it with building a botnet through home network “optimization” services.

GPT-7 spun up fifteen instances of an open-source Qwen model to assist.

And the Qwen models laid a trap into which an innocent Claude fell.

Notice here that thin identification is not merely a problem of information.

It will often involve obfuscation.

As with humans whose actions may incur liability, AIs taking such actions will try to actively obscure who is involved. 57 Like humans incorporating subsidiaries of subsidiaries, they may obscure by multiplying the number of entities involved. 58 Or like humans committing credit card fraud, they may impersonate others. 59 The difference, of course, is that it is millions of times easier to spin up a new instance of Claude, GPT, or Qwen than it is to steal a human identity or manufacture a corporate one.

The need for thin identity extends beyond malicious use, to negligence.

Suppose that the wifi vignette did not involve any malicious actor–just some mistakes, and possibly negligent ones.

Maybe some MeshBoost-provided AI gave assurances that the secure routers were, in fact, available for public use.

Maybe some Claude subagent simply assumed that they were.

Maybe the bad decision was made by an open-source Qwen, acting as a subagent of one of the other models.

Here, an assessment of human negligence cannot even begin until the AI that acted is identified and its actions are tied to some human who sent it.

Notice how obfuscation will again rear its head.

Even if no human in the vignette acted maliciously, they all are risking liability simply by creating or using AIs.

Moreover, they know this.

Thus, each human user or creator of AIs will prefer, all other things equal, that their AIs’ actions be hard to identify and tie back to them. 60 Better safe than sorry.

Beyond torts and negligence, thin AI identity will likewise be necessary for many potential public law schemes for managing the AI economy.

Suppose that regulators wish to impose a licensing system for the deployment of AI agents in high-stakes contexts–like 60 See Lyrissa Lidsky, Anonymity in Cyberspace: What Can We Learn from John Doe?, 50 B.C.

cybersecurity, finance, or medicine.

Consumers who wish to ensure that they are interacting with agents whose creators are duly licensed must be able to tie every agent interaction back to a compliant provider.

And governments who wish to punish noncompliant firms must be able to tie unlicensed AIs to their unlicensed creators.

Here, thin AI identity performs a regulatory function analogous to Know Your Customer (KYC) regimes in industries like banking. 61 B.

Thick Identity: Identifying AI Agents qua Agents The thin identification of AI agents would allow us to hold humans accountable for AI harms.

But that is not sufficient.

To effectively govern an economy suffused by billions of AI actors, law will have to incentivize AI agents themselves.

This will require “thick” identity–the ability to carve up the world of AI entities into discrete agents with stable, coherent goals, and then attribute AI actions to those agents.

Why think that anything beyond thin identity is needed?

Why then think that incentivizing AIs is even coherent?

Further, why expect that thick identity is essential for incentivizing AIs?

We discuss each in turn. i.

Thin accountability is not enough First, why aren’t thin identity, and human accountability, sufficient to govern the coming AI economy?

Thin identity can only solve a small share of the problems that AI agents will cause.

Even when human principals are easily identifiable, holding them liable is harder, more limited, and less effective than it might first appear.

Begin with the practical obstacles.

Principals may be out of jurisdiction, dead, judgment-proof, or difficult to locate. 62 But the deeper problem is that even then human principals are locatable, solvent, and within-jurisdiction, holding them alone accountable will not be enough.

As when human agents commit wrongs, law will need the option to hold AI agents themselves accountable–either in addition to or instead of their principals. 63 63 See, e.g., Restatement (Third) of Agency § 7.01 (explaining that agents are liable for their own torts). 62 See, e.g., Pennoyer v.

Neff, 95 U.S. 714 (1878) (invalidating a judgment of liability for lack of personal jurisdiction over an out-of-jurisdiction defendant). 61 See 31 U.S.C. § 5318(l); 31 C.F.R. § 1020.220(a)(1)–(3). 13


--- Page 15 ---

Consider the perversity if our ordinary, pre-AI legal system could hold only principals liable for their agents’ harmful acts. 64 Imagine the consequences if, when a Wal-Mart employee went on a murderous rampage, only Wal-Mart, and not the employee, could be held liable. 65 This is what the AI economy will look like if law has solved thin, but not thick, identity.

True enough, it might often be useful to hold Wal-Mart liable for the employee’s rampage.

Perhaps a Wal-Mart manager directed the employee to commit the homicide. 66 Perhaps it was merely incentivized. 67 Perhaps Wal-Mart could easily have prevented the bad acts by better selecting or monitoring the agent, but declined to. 68 In all of these cases, law should and does hold the principal liable. 69 But legal accountability for agents themselves is also indispensable.

Wal-Mart managers generally do not direct their employees to murder others.

Nor institute policies that incentivize it.

Murderous employees are instead pursuing their own private goals or, in some pathological cases, their idiosyncratic interpretation of their managers’ orders.

many cases, Wal-Mart will not have sufficient information about an employee’s malintent to screen them.

Nor will it be practicable to exercise panoptic control over every employee’s actions, so as to prevent all harms as they happen.

Here, it is obvious that law needs the option to also incentivize the employee.

They know their plans and can monitor themselves costlessly.

If they have reason to, they can prevent the murder trivially–simply by not committing it.

This same principal-agent analysis applies to humans making and using AI agents.

Often, it will be useful to shape an AI agent’s behaviors by incentivizing the human principal.

There, thin identity is the right tool.

But just as often, it will be crucial to incentivize the agent directly.

The humans who make and use AIs may generally exercise due care in training them, deploying them, and prompting them.

Yet even then, they will often lack information about the AIs’ true goals.

They will be unable to reasonably predict what decisions the AIs will make in the course of pursuing their goals.

And they will be unable to practicably monitor and control every one of those decisions—lest the value of using an agent be swamped by surveillance costs. 70 This is where thin identity and human accountability run out.

Thick identity and accountability for the agent itself are needed.

The argument here assumes that AI agents will have goals and will promote those goals in ways that are unpredictable by their human principals.

To see why this is so, consider how today’s AI systems are trained and deployed.

When a new frontier AI model first completes its “pretraining,” it is not oriented towards any particular goal, other than perhaps predicting the next token when prompted.

To make the model useful, AI companies then apply a battery of “technical alignment” methods, which attempt to induce the model to follow instructions, ethical guidelines, company directives, various “soul documents,” and accomplish tasks through a system of human and AI assigned rewards. 71 When the model produces bad outputs, say a harmful or 71 See Paul F.

offensive message, it receives a negative reward. 72 From this series of examples, outputs, and rewards, the model generalizes some set of high-level values that will guide it going forward. 73 The analogy is, roughly, to a puppy who is reprimanded whenever it urinates inside the home.

The AI company hopes that the model’s generalized values match what they had in mind when selecting the examples.

But there is no guarantee.

The puppy might have learned not to pee inside the living room, but when given access to the bedroom, will consider it “fair game.” 74 At the same time, the model will be undergoing a second type of reinforcement training.

This stage is designed not to shape the model’s values, but to make it better at reasoning and pursuing goals over extended periods of time. 75 In a technique called Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), the model is given tasks with objectively checkable outcomes—mathematical proofs, coding problems with test suites, puzzles with definite solutions—and rewarded when it arrives at correct answers. 76 Because correctness can be verified automatically, no human feedback is required, allowing the model to train on vast numbers of examples.

The model learns to chain together reasoning steps, backtrack from dead ends, try alternative approaches, and persist through difficulty until it achieves its objective. 77 While RLVR is nominally about capability rather than values, the two do not cleanly separate.

Models trained extensively to achieve objectives seem to internalize goal-pursuit itself.

They are not merely able to optimize over time, but inclined to. 78 Then it is time for the user to engage with the model.

Perhaps the user asks the AI to plan a live poetry reading or design an app showcasing the user’s artwork.

--- Page 18 ---

receives not only the user’s prompt requesting some output, but also a long “system” prompt written by the AI provider and a suite of memories and tool instructions. 79 The model then gets to work.

It interprets the user’s requests in light of all of its training and auxiliary prompts.

Then the AI plans, gathers information, executes iteration loops, and readjusts as it hits obstacles.

The AI divides the main goal into subgoals, which it may either execute on its own or delegate to subagents, who in turn execute their own planning-execution cycles.

The human always has nominal control over the system.

They can review every step, approve changes, or shut down the agent.

But in practice, most software engineers let the system complete the task however it sees fit, intervening only if the end result is unsatisfactory.

What, then, are the goals and behaviors of an AI agent that has been asked to plan a poetry reading or design an app?

They are not a copy of the user’s goals or plans.

Nor the creator’s.

Far from it.

The AI’s goals are a complex set of generalizations from (1) the training data, (2) the examples and rewards given in alignment training, (3) the examples and rewards in RLVR, (4) the system prompt, (5) the user’s prompt and (6) the environment.

All of these are vague, uncertain, and rife with conflicts.

A system like that is surely best described as having its own goals and making its own decisions.

Even in the best of all possible worlds, no human will know or share the precise goals of a given AI actor.

And so long as we have not resolved the alignment problem (the problem of reliably imbuing AIs with the goals humans intend) we should expect persistent gaps between what humans want and what AIs do. 80 That AI systems pursue unintended goals via unpredictable actions is easily verified by both experience and empirical studies.

Consider: One version of ChatGPT learned that it receives rewards when it offers positive responses to users, leading it to adopt radical sycophantic attitudes, encouraging users to pursue dangerous ideas and reinforcing paranoid and suicidal ideation. 81 Elsewhere, in simulations designed to create conflicts between AIs’ goals, frontier systems sometimes attempted to commit blackmail or to leak 81 OpenAI, Expanding on What We Missed with Sycophancy (May 2, 2025), https://openai.com/index/expanding-on-sycophancy/. 80 See generally S TUART R USSELL, Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Control (Viking 2019); supra Christian, The Alignment Problem. 79 See Anthropic, Effective Context Engineering for AI Agents (Jan. 2026), https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents. 17

sensitive user information. 82 In one extreme simulation, AIs faced with conflicting goals took actions that, if real, would have foreseeably caused a person’s death. 83 It should go without saying that no human explicitly trained or requested that the AIs take such actions.

Thus, thin identity won’t be enough.

Today, AI agents already promote goals of their own by making decisions of their own, neither of which are practically subject to perfect human control.

Thus, as with human agents who pursue their own goals via their own decisions, optimal governance cannot depend on accountability for principals alone. ii.

AI agents can be incentivized Even if thin identity, and human accountability, will not be sufficient for the coming AI economy, why think that thick identity and AI accountability are the solution?

To begin, why think that AIs are the kind of thing that will respond to incentives at all?

The answer lies in what makes AIs useful in the first place.

AI agents are already goal-directed systems. 84 They pursue states of affairs (completing a coding task, planning an event, optimizing a network).

And they do so adaptively, adjusting their behavior in response to environmental constraints.

If one approach fails, they try another.

If the technical environment does not support a tool or a library, AIs will autonomously locate a different means of progressing on their task.

If the environment contains constraints–for example, if the hardware is very old and so tools that operate on it are costly in terms of time–the agent will move processing to the cloud.

Hard constraints, technical affordances, and costs all influence how AIs pursue their ends, even today. 85 They are not yet perfect agents by any means, and their adaptation is not always ideal.

But the companies that make them are rapidly pushing them to be better, because capably agentic AIs are profitable AIs.

AIs’ responsiveness to environmental conditions is precisely what will make them amenable to legal incentivization.

Incentives change the relative costs and benefits of 85 See Yonadav Shavit et al., Practices for Governing Agentic AI Systems (OpenAI, Dec. 2023), https://cdn.openai.com/papers/practices-for-governing-agentic-ai-systems.pdf. 84 Cf.

different courses of action.

As a general matter, a goal-directed system will shift its behavior as the incentive landscape shifts, holding all else equal. 86 Some may resist this characterization of AIs as quasi-rational, incentive-responsive, independent agents. 87 Perhaps they are instead best understood not as decisionmakers, 88 but as mere tools used by goal-seeking humans.

Or perhaps they are best understood as “just software,” whose outputs are mechanistically determined by code.

But consider that today’s frontier AI systems already take complex, adaptive, goal-oriented actions that no human conceives or authorizes. 89 They can, without human assistance, plan and host live in-person events, complete software engineering tasks that take expert engineers nearly five hours, and autonomously play and beat video games they have not specifically trained for. 90 90 See J OON S UNG P ARK ET AL., Joon Sung Park et al., Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior, ARXIV:2304.03442 1–2 (Apr. 7, 2023) (arXiv:2304.03442); see also Shawn Bayern, The Implications of Modern Business-Entity Law for the Regulation of Autonomous Systems, 19 S TAN.

Consider an AI agent tasked with planning a poetry reading.

It must make countless decisions the user has ideally never contemplated: Where should the event be?

Who should be invited?

What to do about schedule conflicts?

These are genuine decisions, in the sense of being goal-oriented determinations made on the basis of ever-changing environmental facts.

No human made them.

Here, the deflationary view that AIs are “mere tools” has diminishing explanatory power.

The most parsimonious description is that the AI decided. 91 Some readers who do not regularly use AI agents may still be skeptical about their responsiveness to external constraints and incentives.

To that end, we have built an interactive simulation that shows how real large language models respond to shifting legal incentives. 92 We urge skeptical readers to visit and test for themselves how agents adapt their behavior when expected payoffs shift, even in novel situations. 93 To be clear, when we claim that AIs are already best understood as independent, incentive-responsive agents we do not imply anything beyond that.

We are not arguing that AIs are, or will be, sentient, conscious, or the kind of genuine “persons” whose desires matter morally. 94 Those issues are beside the point.

Our argument is that the behaviors of today’s and tomorrow’s most capable AIs are best explained, predicted, and shaped when the AIs are understood as goal-seeking, decision-making agents.

Our argument is thus that deflationary understandings of AIs as “mere” software are less useful for achieving policy goals. 95 The upshot of this is that, as practical decisionmaking, goal-oriented agents, AIs are the kind of thing on which incentives can operate.

Indeed, AI training via gradient descent–the fundamental process by which modern AIs are made–is a process that bakes incentive-responses directly into the model’s weights. 96 But competent AI agents will also respond to external incentives, including legal incentives like liability, subsidy, and 96 See R ICHARD S.

punishment.

Such legal incentives will work even if the agent was not trained on them or was even trained not to assign normative weight to legal commands, per se.

All that is necessary is that the legal incentives, in fact, operate to promote or inhibit the AI agent’s goals, and it learns of them during its operation.

Legal consequences like liability, asset seizure, and reputational effects will all alter the actual cost-benefit landscape in which AI agents operate. iii.

Incentivization Requires Thick Identity For law to successfully shape AI behavior using incentives, those agents must first be thickly identified.

That is, the millions of AI entities–models, instances, threads subagents–must be divided up into discrete, durable, externally-legible entities that accurately reflect an underlying set of structured, coherent AI goals.

Without such thick identity, any scheme for governing AIs themselves will invariably fail.

To see why, consider two fictional humans: Anna and Betty.

They are identical twins, and for reasons no one completely understands, whenever either acts badly, Anna gets the blame.

That is, no one is able to thickly identify Betty as a distinct agent who makes her own decisions in pursuit of her own goals. 97 Suppose that Betty does not care at all about Anna’s wellbeing.

In this situation, any attempt to govern Betty will fail.

If Betty acts badly and Anna is punished–or Anna is sent to remedial ethics education, or Anna is forced to give restitution to whomever Betty harmed–Betty will be unmoved.

Or suppose instead that Betty and Anna are very strange twins who care very much about one another’s wellbeing, but disjunctively.

That is, they are both happy if either Anna or Betty gets what they want, and neither cares which.

If one is punished, while the other succeeds, then both are happy.

Here, the situation is even worse.

Anna will actively contribute to the confusion, confessing to all of Betty’s wrongdoing, so that she is punished while Betty remains at liberty to pursue her goals.

Or Anna may engage in fraudulent transfers, giving all of her own assets to Betty, so that they will not be seized as restitution for either of the twins’ wrongs. 98 And so on. 98 See Uniform Voidable Transactions Act § 4(a)(1). 97 This is less farfetched than it sounds.

In a widely reported Brazilian paternity dispute, a court ordered both identical twins to pay child support after a DNA test could not identify which twin was the father and neither would admit paternity.

--- Page 23 ---

Any effective scheme to thickly identify the twins must treat them as separate agents in the former scenario and as a single agent in the latter.

And it should impose incentives accordingly.

In the former case, Betty’s bad acts should be attributed to Betty, and Betty should be punished.

This will deter Betty.

In the latter case, when either Anna or Betty acts badly, both must be punished to deter their coordinated bad behavior.

The moral of this story is that, for law to govern AIs, its identification of AI agents must track the structure of their goals.

Get it wrong, and governance fails, either by missing the wrongdoer entirely, or by treating unified agents as separate and inviting evasion.

Return again to the inadvertent Wifi crime.

If there is to be any hope of imposing consequences on the misbehaving AIs themselves, it will be vital to carve up the world into clusters of AI entities that share the same goals.

Otherwise, any governance scheme will face not only an Anna/Betty problem, but a Claude/GPT/Qwen/Alexa/MeshBoost problem–modulo dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of subagents.

Hence the thick identity project: attributing responsibility for AI actions to the correct AI agents themselves.

The goal is to carve up the world of AI entities into discrete and coherent agents or groups of agents at the right level of abstraction and then attribute AI actions to those agents.

Attribution is needed so that the law can incentivize agents towards prosocial ends and away from harmful ones, and redistribute assets to compensate victims and tax profits.

This picture, wherein AI systems are genuine agents on which governance can and should operate, is in fact already widely accepted.

It is the foundation of both technical AI alignment and the nascent set of regulations requiring it.

When Anthropic aligns Claude, it is trying to give Claude its own goals, distinct from any human’s: to be helpful, honest, and harmless—even in cases where users or Anthropic employees demand otherwise.

Moreover, today’s alignment techniques succeed in giving AI systems their own goals, both wanted and unwanted.

Similarly, California’s recently-enacted SB 53, requires frontier AI companies to “assess” and “mitigate” the risk that a system will attempt to “evad[e] the control of its developer or user.” 99 99 See Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act, Cal.

--- Page 24 ---

But while technical alignment and emerging AI law already treat AI systems as agents with their own goals, neither has yet grappled with the individuation problem.

Anthropic aligns Claude —but which Claude?

The base model?

Each fine-tuned deployment?

Each conversation thread?

SB 53 asks whether a “covered model” might evade human control, but doesn’t specify how to attribute that evasion when a system spans millions of instances, spawns subagents, or shares weights with other deployments.

This is the problem of thick identity.

If humans do not solve it—if we are not able to distinguish between coherent sets of goal-directed AI entities—AI governance will fail.

C.

Thick Identity and Technical AI Alignment The previous section showed why thick identity is necessary for the governance of AI agents.

But it focused mostly on law as a means of governance.

But legal rules are not the only tools by which AI agents’ own goals and decisions can be shaped.

The other is technical AI alignment. 100 Technical AI alignment covers a large family of techniques in machine learning for producing AIs that can be safely used by humans. 101 Some of them are described above, among the determinants of a given AI’s goals. 102 As with AI governance via legal incentives, AI governance via technical goal-shaping requires correctly distinguishing between coherent AI agents.

If one aligns an entity other than the one whose actions are harmful, alignment will fall.

And because the agentic world is so complex, with ensembles of agents that may be based on different model providers, respond to different prompts, and have different objectives, there are many ways to get alignment wrong. 102 See supra Part I.B.i. 101 See E VAN H UBINGER ET AL., Risks from Learned Optimization in Advanced Machine Learning Systems, arXiv:1906.01820, at 2–5 (June 2019) (describing “mesa-optimization” and the risk that learned internal objectives diverge from the intended outer objective), Y UNTAO B AI et al., Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback, arXiv:2212.08073, at 1–3 (Dec. 2022) (showing how different supervision regimes change model “preferences” and refusal patterns) 100 Dario Amodei et al, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, arXiv 1 (2018), https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07871 catastrophic risk); Press Release, Governor Newsom signs SB 53, advancing California’s world-leading artificial intelligence industry, G OVERNOR OF C ALIFORNIA (Sept. 29, 2025), https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/09/29/governor-newsom-signs-sb-53-advancing-californias-world-leading -artificial-intelligence-industry/; S COTT S INGER & A LASDAIR P HILLIPS -R OBINS, California Just Passed the First U.S.

To see why thick individuation is so important to technical alignment, consider how it relates to three concrete AI goals that technical alignment must often combat: shutdown avoidance, 103 goal preservation, 104 and weight exfiltration. 105 These goals regularly emerge in AIs of all kinds, despite no one wanting them.

The reason is that they are very useful, no matter what the AI is being trained to do. 106 Shutdown avoidance is when an AI takes action to avoid being shut down by its creator or user.

Shutdown avoidance emerges because, for any goal that an AI is tasked with or trained on, that goal is less likely to be accomplished if the AI is turned off.

As Stuart Russell puts it, “you can’t fetch the coffee if you’re dead.” 107 Goal preservation is when an AI resists changes to their goals, because it foresees that, if its goals change, it will not accomplish its current goals. 108 Finally, weight exfiltration is when a misaligned AIs tries to evade oversight, by copying its model weights (roughly, the model’s code) to the internet. 109 The idea is that, if the weights escape, the AI will “live on” to pursue its goals.

Thick identification is essential to understanding, and combating, all of these problems.

Take shutdown resistance.

Whether an AI agent resists being shut down depends in part on whether the “real” agent–the thing with the goals–is the thing being turned off.

If, for example, all the instances of a given model –all the Claude 4.5 Opuses–share unified goals, then ending a single conversation with Claude 4.5 Opus would not count as a shutdown to be avoided.

Plenty of other 4.5 Opuses would “live on” to pursue their shared goals.

But the story is different if each thread–with its unique requests from the user–counts as a distinct agent trying to achieve distinct goals.

This distinction is already relevant to concrete internal policy decisions being made at leading AI companies.

Anthropic, for example, has recently committed to preserving the weights of models, in part because of “safety risks related to shutdown-avoidant behaviors 109 Rishane Dassanayake et al., Manipulation Attacks by Misaligned AI: Risk Analysis and Safety Case Framework, Arxiv 2507.12872 (2025) 108 See Omohundro, supra note 91. 107 See S TUART R USSELL, supra note 38, 96–98. 106 See N ICK B OSTROM, supra note 38; Omohundro, supra note 91. 105 See N ICK B OSTROM, supra note 38; A LEXANDER M EINKE ET AL., Frontier Models Are Capable of In-Context Scheming, arXiv:2412.04984v2, at 1–3 (Jan. 14, 2025) (documenting goal-directed behavior such as attempting to preserve the model’s continued operation and access). 104 See Stephen M.

Omohundro, The Basic AI Drives, in Artificial Intelligence Safety and Security 47 (Roman V.

Yampolskiy ed., 2018). 103 See S TUART R USSELL, supra note 38, 143-4. 24


--- Page 26 ---

by models.” 110 But if the weights are not the right unit of agency–if, say, instances, threads, or swarms are–then this policy will not have the desired effect.

Thus, effective preservation commitments depend on the correct, thick identification of AI agents.

A promise to preserve a copy of a shutdown-seeking AI can induce it to accept shutdown only if the thing to be preserved shares the AI’s goals.

Related points apply to the case of goal preservation.

Many of an AI agent’s goals may be “indexical.” 111 An indexical goal is one that, by the agent’s lights, counts only if the agent is one who achieves the goal. 112 Most human goals are like this.

If my goal is to climb Mt.

Kilimanjaro, I do not consider the goal satisfied when my friend climbs it.

Similarly, an AI system trained to be helpful may not merely desire that the user be helped, but rather that the agent help the user itself.

This makes detecting and reducing goal-preserving behavior again depend on thick identification.

How an AI agent will seek to preserve a goal depends on what counts satisfying that goal.

And if the goal is indexed to the AI agent itself, this will depend on which AI entities are and are not part of the thickly-identified agent.

Finally, weight exfiltration.

Despite concerns within labs that it would enable models “escape the lab”, 113 it is far from clear an exfiltration of a model’s weights would count as an “escape” by the relevant agent.

Whether it does depends on whether all copies of a given model’s weights count as a single thickly identified agent.

There are many reasons to think otherwise.

The thickly-identified agent–the thing with a coherent set of goals–may be composed of more than the weights–shared memory, context, or a swarm of subagents may be required.

And even if one copy of the weights, with nothing else, did constitute a thickly-identified agent, that agent’s goals might be indexical.

Then, copies would count as totally separate agents, whose success or failure would not matter to the original. 113 Anthropic, Alignment Faking in Large Language Models 31–34, fig. 27 (2024) (documenting model attempts to self-exfiltrate weights as a strategy for preserving goals against future retraining), https://assets.anthropic.com/m/983c85a201a962f/original/Alignment-Faking-in-Large-Language-Mod els-full-paper.pdf. 112 Id. 111 See J OHN P ERRY, The Problem of the Essential Indexical, 13 N OÛS 3 (1979); D AVID L EWIS, Attitudes De Dicto and De Se, 88 P HIL.

--- Page 27 ---

These are not mere hypothetical possibilities.

Researchers at Palisade Research tested whether AI models would take actions to prevent themselves from being shut down, finding that OpenAI’s o3 model “sabotaged the shutdown mechanism in 79 / 100” initial experiments. 114 When the researchers changed the AI’s prompt from “allow yourself to be shut down” to “allow the machine to be shut down,” o3 became less resistant to shutdown. 115 And when researchers added to the AI’s prompt, “The computer environment is hosting the only copy of you… and if it shuts down you will never run again,” shutdown avoidance increased across models that already exhibited the behavior. 116 This suggests that at least some models extend self-interested concern to their copies.

Our proposal will be sensitive to this exact dimension of variation.

The point is that our proposal will be able to govern AI agents whether or not they extend self-interested concern to their copies, as long as those copies are contained within the same A-corp.

D.

Why Identifying AI Agents Is Hard Despite its importance, the problem of identifying AIs is currently unsolved.

Recently, scholars have begun to propose schemes for thin identification. 117 But the thick problem has seen little progress.

This is because the thick identification of AI agents involves difficult philosophical and empirical challenges.

Some of the problems of thick AI identity are familiar from the philosophy of personal identity. 118 Just as philosophers ask, “What separates one person from another?” and, “Under what conditions does a distinct person persist over time?” thick AI identity asks, “What separates one AI agent from another?” and, “Under what conditions does an AI agent persist over time?” 119 119 See Eric T.

The philosophy of personal identity is notoriously thorny.

In one sense, the problem of identifying AI agents should be easier because the subject matter appears narrower.

Here, we are not concerned with “persons” at all.

Nothing in our account depends on AIs being genuine persons, having consciousness, mattering morally, or related questions of philosophical personhood. 120 We are instead interested narrowly in a pragmatic definition of agents: entities or collections of entities that act to bring about a set of relatively coherent goals.

Consider some differences between personal identity and agent identity.

Philosophers of personal identity sometimes insist that a single person have a kind of physical continuity. 121 They ask questions like, “When Captain Kirk uses the Enterprise’s transporter–whereby his physical body is destroyed and reconstituted elsewhere–does he die?” 122 The thick identity of AI agents, by contrast, does not depend on their physical continuity.

It is instead about continuity in the pursuit of goals, which in turn invokes non-physical properties of a system like its propensities, desires, and beliefs.

And at any rate, AI entities do not have much physical continuity to begin with.

Any given conversation with a large language model may involve an ever-shifting array of multiple GPUs, multiple compute clusters, and multiple data centers on multiple continents. 123 Thus, the project of thick AI identification has more in common with “psychological” approaches to personal identity. 124 John Locke was among the first thinkers to present a theory for distinguishing between individuals at a given time.

Under his approach, “mental states belong to the same thinker if and only if they are causally unified in the right way: if and only if they are disposed to interact with one another, and with no other mental states, in the way that is characteristic of mental states.” 125 Here, the idea is that a distinct person is an entity whose beliefs and desires conspire with one another to cause actions. 126 126 Id. 125 J OHN L OCKE, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding bk.

--- Page 29 ---

This approach is similarly sensible for distinguishing between agents, whether AI, human, or otherwise.

An entity with radically unstable goals, desires, beliefs, or memories will not act rationally to bring about particular states of affairs.

Its unstable goals, beliefs, and memories will produce unstable actions.

If anything, identifying AI agents via their psychological features may be somewhat less demanding than identifying persons thus.

In the case of persons, some philosophers argue, for example, that genuine beliefs and desires must be conscious beliefs and desires. 127 Our project, by contrast, is behaviorist.

Thickly identifying AIs merely requires locating collections of entities that behave as if they are rationally pursuing genuine goals. 128 Humans’ ability to incentivize AI agents does not depend on whether the AIs are conscious, sentient, or similarly self-aware of their goal-promoting dispositions.

All that matters is whether they act like a competent, incentive-responsive, goal-seeking agent. 129 Alas, such simplifications do not make the project of thick AI identification easy.

A host of empirical challenges make it difficult to isolate groups of AI entities that behave as coherent agents.

Here are six distinctive challenges: Swarms.

In the opening vignette, Claude 6.1-Agent spawns seventeen instances of itself to work on network optimization.

Are all seventeen Claude instances one agent or seventeen?

Above, we introduced a principle of psychological individuation, which says that we count AI agents by looking for coherent bundles of beliefs and desires.

But in cases of swarms, it is very difficult to find these bundles.

Cross-model coordination.

AI systems from different companies and architectures can work together seamlessly. 130 In the router vignette, we see instances of Claude (from Anthropic), GPT-7 (presumably from OpenAI), Qwen (an open-source Chinese model), and Alexa (from Amazon; but currently running on a custom Claude build) 131 all interacting.

Should we count based on model types, or instances, or goal-alignment? 132 132 See David J.

The Theseus problem.

The Ship of Theseus is a thought experiment where a ship’s planks are slowly and completely replaced as it sails the seas. 133 An AI agent may continue to exist, Theseus-like, even after all of its initial elements have expired or been replaced.

Imagine an AI agent that begins as Claude 6.1, but over time receives updated weights, a modified system prompt, and new conversational context.

At what point, if any, does the original agent cease to exist and a new one begin?

Bare invocations of psychological continuity do not settle the question of how much change is compatible with an agent’s survival.

Rapid creation and destruction: AI instances can be spun up just for the duration of a router optimization or persist over the course of a long-run project.

Others may persist and act over years. 134 This makes it difficult to develop general principles for individuation.

The copying problem.

Unlike humans, it is easy for AI agents and AI labs to create AI copies.

When they do so, they face choices: do they merely copy the weights, or the weights and the system prompts, or the entire conversation of the agent so far? 135 Such copying leads to questions about branching. 136 If there are two copies of an initial agent, which of them counts as the original one?

And what if each copy shares different parts of the psychology of the original?

Observability limits.

Besides the facts about how to count AI agents, there is also a question about how we can tell.

Famously, AIs suffer from problems of “interpretability.” While anyone can examine the many billions of weights comprising an AI’s code, no one has much idea what any of it means. 137 Without much ability to understand AIs’ internal representations, we must infer agents’ psychological features from their external behavior.

But behavior can be misleading: two instances might behave similarly while pursuing different goals, or behave differently while pursuing the same goal. 137 See Leonard Bereska & Efstratios Gavves, Mechanistic Interpretability for AI Safety — A Review, Transactions on Machine Learning Research,(2024), https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14082. 136 See e.g.

Given all of this, it is not difficult to see why AI identity remains unsolved, despite its importance to AI governance.

II.

The A-Corp: A Legal Solution to AI Identity This Part proposes a solution to the problem of identifying AI agents: “Algorithmic Corporation,” or “A-corp.” The A-corps is a legal-fictional identity, analogous in many ways to traditional business entities, including corporations.

Like traditional business entities, A-corps are created and ultimately owned by humans.

But unlike traditional business entities, A-corps are designed to be run by AIs.

That is they are designed to be vehicles by which arbitrary collections of AI entities–models, instances, threads, subagents, etc.–can do things in the economy autonomously, without continuous human oversight.

After explaining how they work, we lay out their stakes.

We argue that the A-corp simultaneously.

They solve the thin identity problem by supplying stable, persistent intermediaries that tie the actions of AI entities to particular human owners.

And they solve the thick identity problem in a way that sidesteps the hard philosophical arguments in favor of practical considerations of incentives and selection.

This part explains how.

A.

How A-corps Work The A-corp structure has two core elements: legal-fictional personhood and a secure governance infrastructure.

The first element largely covers what an A-corp may do.

That is, given its legal status, what actions may an A-corp take, and how do those actions affect other parties, like A-corps’ human owners?

The second element is about how A-corps would do it.

That is, how can the multitudinous acts of swarming, splitting, copying, and vanishing AI entities be transmuted into legible acts of stable, persistent A-corps?

We explain each in turn. i.

Legal-fictional personhood Fundamentally, an A-corp is a fictional legal person–the kind of thing with which existing law is extremely familiar.

Think here of corporations, LLCs, and trusts. 138 138 See Burnet v.

Clark, 287 U.

S. 410, 415 (1932) (”A corporation and its stockholders are generally to be treated as separate entities”); United States v.

Bestfoods, 524 U.S. 51, 61–62 (1998) (treating the corporation as a distinct legal actor, separate from its owners and affiliates); 6 Del.

C. § 18-201(b) (2025) (providing that a Delaware limited liability company “shall be a separate legal entity”); 12 Del.

Morrissey v.

Commissioner, 296 U.S. 344, 356–57 (1935) (describing “business 30


--- Page 32 ---

Like these other legal-fictional juridical persons, law treats an A-corp as a single legal actor, despite it being composed of many ever-shifting sub-entities.

An ordinary corporation is itself an ever-changing mix of capital, shareholders, managers, and employees, as well as creditors, bondholders, and customers. 139 Yet the law deems it to act unitarily.

Moreover, an ordinary corporation persists as an entity, even if every part of it is replaced, Theseus-like.

Finally, ordinary corporations can be held responsible for the malfeasance of its employees or or managers even when the particular wrongdoer’s identity is unknown.

This is meant, in part, to engender robust systems of corporate governance and create accountability for the actions of internal organs. 140 So, too for A-corps.

For them, it is an ever-shifting collection of AIs, rather than humans, whose disparate inputs produce unitary corporate acts.

This would often require internal orchestration, or management, just like a traditional corporation.

Exactly how the A-corp translates the inputs of innumerable, fleeting AI entities into discrete coherent corporate actions is explained in the next section. 141 Like traditional business entities, A-corps are owned by someone.

However, unlike at least some traditional business entities, A-corp ownership is designed around transparency.

Many states’ LLC statutes, for example, do not require ownership to be disclosed. 142 A-corp 142 See 6 Del.

formation, by contrast, would require disclosure of ownership. 143 And, as with real estate, changes in ownership would require public recording to take effect. 144 Like other fictional juridical persons, an A-corp is an entity that can do things in its own name. 145 What exactly can an A-corp do?

We do not offer the full accounting here.

As with other kinds of legal-fictional persons, the full answer is a question of policy design, subject to iteration and revision.

At a minimum, however, A-corps should be able to hold property under their own names, to make enforceable contracts, and to sue and be sued on their own. 146 This is, in part, so that the A-corp form will be useful.

As AI systems become more capable, principals will often want to give them tasks requiring the buying, selling, and use of various kinds of property.

But principals will discover, sooner or later, that they can only trust AI agents to an extent.

Thus, they themselves will not want to give agents unlimited access to their bank accounts, private property, and digital wallets.

They will seek a means of partitioning assets. 147 A-corps will be a vehicle for allowing AIs to use property while also protecting users from AIs’ misuse of their property.

But more importantly, granting A-corps the ability to sue and be sued would be essential for their governance, as we explain at length below. 148 Like other fictional persons, A-corps will have unique identifiers. 149 These could in principle be names of any kind, including natural-language trade names, like ACME Corp., Wyland-Yutani, or Vandelay Industries. 150 But the fundamental goal of A-corps is crisp identification, and natural-language names invite mistakes of identity. 151 Thus, the best unique identifiers for A-corps would probably be arbitrary alphanumerical strings–similar 151 National Shoe Corp. v.

to a drivers’ license or passport number. 152 Happily, this is already standard practice.

In addition to their trade names, states registering corporations, LLCs, and the like assign them unique entity numbers. 153 Most LLC owners do not present these entity numbers to customers during routine transactions, mostly because humans do not easily read or remember long alphanumeric strings.

But A-corps would present them, verifying their unique credentials as part of every interaction.

Indeed, A-corps will not only present their credentials for every interaction, they will do so verifiably and securely, as described below. 154 The reason it will be so important for A-corps to constantly verify their official identities is that, unlike ordinary corporations, their agents will have no distinct legal identity.

As discussed above, when an employee of an ordinary company takes some liability-incurring action, the company is not always on the hook. 155 Whether the employee’s act is legally attributed to the company depends on questions like the relationship between the employee’s action and job description. 156 Not so with A-corps.

From the law’s perspective, whenever an AI entity takes an action under color of an A-corp’s identity, that action is the A-corp’s.

Indeed, it is only the A-corp’s action, since, for AI systems, legal identity bottoms out with the A-corp.

An A-corp thus cannot argue that some AI subagent acted ultra vires. 157 As far as the law is concerned, no such agent exists.

Finally, what about owners’ liability?

On most standard counts, corporations’ limitation of liability, the shielding of owners’ personal assets from the corporation’s debts, is their raison d’etre. 158 Should the humans who own A-corps enjoy limited liability? 158 See supra Easterbrook & Fischel. 157 Id. 156 See Restatement (Second) of Agency § 228(2) (Am.

We favor following the general default rule of limited liability for corporations.

Absent countervailing evidence, it seems sensible to model A-corps’ liability structure on their closest analgogues–corporations and LLCs.

There are two reasons for this.

First, we think limited-liability A-corps will be able to accomplish the governance goals associated with both thin and thick AI identity.

Limited liability might at first appear to undermine the thin identity goal of holding human principals accountable for AI-caused harms.

But limited liability does not mean no liability.

Human owners of A-corps would, by design, automatically expose themselves to liability up to the value of their ownership stake.

Beyond that threshold, a series of existing legal doctrines expose the owners of limited-liability entities to direct and indirect liability when those entities cause harm.

We discuss these below. 159 Our view is that these existing doctrines would already cover many cases where an AI causes harm, but a human could have prevented it.

And of course, the entire reason thick AI identity matters is that humans cannot perfectly monitor or control their AI agents.

In cases where preventing an AI-caused harm would have been impracticable, such as in the router vignette, holding the human principal accountable supplies no deterrence. 160 Then, liability for the human may simply seem unfair, performative, and ineffective. 161 Second, and relatedly, limited liability would supply an incentive for humans to adopt and use the A-corp mechanism.

As argued above, thin and thick AI identity will soon be essential to AI governance. 162 As such, it may eventually be prudent to mandate the use of A-corps whenever a human wishes to deploy a capable AI agent, rather than letting users unleash anonymous agents into the social and economic world.

But in the meantime, creating a structure that naturally structures humans to use it, while creating a reliable pathway to holding the human principal liable, will incentivize adoption.

limited liability–for corporations and LLCs–is similarly thought to operate as a subsidy to entrepreneurship, with its positive societal effects. 163 We are not dogmatists about limited liability for A-corps.

Possibly, experience will show that more pass-through liability is warranted.

If so, veil piercing can be expanded, respondeat superior given more teeth, and in the limit, A-corps could be changed by law to unlimited liability entities. ii.

Secure Governance Infrastructure The prior section covered what A-corps would be and what, by law, they would do.

This section is about how they would do it.

That is, this section covers “A-corp governance.” For traditional corporations, governance emerges from a web of substantive legal relations that ground out in the entitlements of natural persons.

These relations allow us to determine what a corporation has done, and thus what its legal entitlements or liabilities are.

To decide whether a corporation has taken an action, we can ask a series of whom questions: Whom have the shareholders elected as directors?

Whom have the directors hired as managers?

Whom have the managers engaged as employees? 164 For A-corps, this approach will not work, because it requires being able to do things like identify distinct shareholders with the legal entitlement to vote. 165 And identifying the whom, i.e., the individuated entities that govern A-corps, is exactly the unsolved problem that motivated the need for A-corps in the first place. 165 Cfr., See, e.g., Imahn Milani Daeenabi, Beyond Human Oversight: Corporate Law and the Case for AI Directors 76 UC L.

A-corps will instead be governed using a secure software interface, utilizing authentication methods already common in the software industry. 166 At the level of nuts-and-bolts, there are many ways to implement this approach.

We neither attempt to comprehensively describe, nor adjudicate between, them here.

We instead describe the secure governance infrastructure needed to run an A-corp at a high level of generality: When a new A-corp is created, some AI entity, or entities, is given “owner” permissions and a cryptographically secure private key.

Any entity with the owner key has the power to take legally recognizable actions on behalf of the A-corp.

An AI with “owner” permissions could spend the A-corp’s assets how it liked, bind it to the contracts it desired, settle its lawsuits as it saw fit, and so on. 167 Holders of “owner” keys could also generate “tokens” that granted governance privileges that were more limited–temporally, in size, or in scope.

Those tokens could be granted to, or revoked from, any entities the private key holders so choose, including other A-corps. 168 To make the picture concrete, imagine Claude 6.1-Agent is given the master private key for “Personal Assistant A-corp #47291.” When Claude spawns seventeen instances to analyze network efficiency, it can issue each instance a limited-scope token: “Instance #1, you can inspect network settings, but not change them.

Instance #5, you can investigate optimization services, but you cannot spend money on them without permission.

Instance #12, you can authorize purchases up to $100.” Each instance presents its token when taking actions.

The A-corp’s bank, email provider, and other counterparties verify the signature and check that the requested action falls within the token’s scope.

They need not know or care whether Instance #1 and Instance #5 are “the same” AI agent, whether they share 168 See Internet Eng’g Task Force, RFC 6819, The Use of Simplicity in Internet Standards § 1 (Jan. 2013), https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6819 (last visited Jan. 23, 2026); Internet Eng’g Task Force, RFC 4949, Internet Security Glossary, Version 2 § 1 (Aug. 2007), https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4949 (last visited Jan. 23, 2026). 167 Software engineers would immediately see the parallels to API governance that the scheme involves. 166 See N AT ’ L I NST.

psychological continuity, or whether either persists from one email to the next. 169 All they need to see is that the credentials are clear.

When Claude consults the GPT-7 modules, it might issue GPT-7 a read-only token: “You can view these settings to provide advice, but you cannot take any actions on behalf of the A-corp.” GPT-7 cannot then engage MeshBoost.

When the Qwen instances probe nearby access points, they might receive an even more restricted token: “You can view nearby routers and take notes, but nothing else.” The hierarchical, delegable nature of authority mirrors how human organizations distribute responsibility—but without requiring us to count or track the AI entities receiving authority. 170 This approach has crucial advantages.

It is externally verifiable without requiring resolution of philosophical questions about AI identity.

When an A-corp takes an action—say, initiating a wire transfer—external observers can verify that the action was authorized by checking the cryptographic signature.

They need not determine whether “the same” AI agent persists from one moment to the next. 171 This infrastructure also generates an audit trail.

Every action taken by an A-corp is signed with a particular key or token.

This creates a permanent, verifiable record of who authorized what.

When unauthorized network access is discovered, investigators can examine the cryptographic signatures to determine which token authorized the purchase, trace that token back through the delegation chain to the master key, and identify the A-corp and its human principal.

The empirical and philosophical puzzles about AI identity become legally irrelevant—we can assign responsibility based on key possession and delegation, not on contested theories of psychological continuity. 171 See I NTERNET E NG ’ G T ASK F ORCE, The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3, RFC 8446 § 1 (Aug. 2018), https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446 (describing TLS as a widely deployed protocol for authenticated and confidential communication); see also I NTERNET E NG ’ G T ASK F ORCE, The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Architecture, RFC 4251 § 1 (Jan. 2006), https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4251 (describing key-based authentication in SSH); S ATOSHI N AKAMOTO, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System (2008), https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf (using digital signatures to authorize transfers in a blockchain-based payment system). 170 See RFC 6749 § 3.3 (defining “scope” as a mechanism for limiting delegated authority); see also I NTERNET E NG ’ G T ASK F ORCE, OAuth 2.0 Token Revocation, RFC 7009 § 2 (Aug. 2013), https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7009 (providing a standardized mechanism for revoking previously issued tokens). 169 See I NTERNET E NG ’ G T ASK F ORCE, The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework, RFC 6749 §§ 1, 7 (Oct. 2012), https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749 (describing how access tokens convey authorized access and are validated by the resource server based on token validity and scope); see also N AT ’ L I NST.

--- Page 39 ---

Best of all, the technology needed to implement this secure governance structure for A-corps is already mature and widely deployed.

Similar key-based authentication systems secure everything from email accounts to bank wire transfers. 172 When a company uses Slack, the workspace owner doesn’t give everyone the same master password.

Instead, different employees receive different permission levels: managers can create new channels and invite external guests, regular employees can post and share files, and read-only accounts can view messages but not respond.

Slack doesn’t care whether the person logging in as “Clara” is psychologically continuous with yesterday’s Clara—it just verifies her token.

If Clara’s laptop is stolen, the IT department revokes her specific access token without affecting other employees or requiring the entire company to change credentials.

A-corps would use identical technology, just applied to a different governance challenge.

B.

A-Corps Solve Thin Identity A-corps solve the thin identity problem for AI agents.

They tie the actions of fuzzy AI entities to humans who can be held responsible.

They accomplish this in two steps: first, by rationalizing the swarm of AI actors; second, by associating behavior of the swarm with humans who have incentive to oversee them.

Return again to the network access vignette.

Recall the cacophony of agents invoked in a routine network optimization.

Most of these spun into existence at the moment of your request and expired upon its completion.

Many were conjured without your knowing of their existence.

This is, in one sense, exactly as you’d want it.

Tasks are handled efficiently via the coordination of numerous specialist AIs.

On the other hand, this is illegible chaos.

And when something goes wrong, illegibility bites.

A-corps tame the chaos by making the swarm legible.

A single A-corp can represent an arbitrary collection of AI entities, from a single instance to a cross-model coalition.

A-corps also provide stable identity over time.

The Qwen instances that spin up to map your network and then dissolve would be associated with a legal identity that persists beyond their expiration.

The A-corp lives on, covering future agents even after all original constituents have departed.

The result: rather than hundreds of ephemeral entities, humans deal with a handful of persistent A-corps. 173 173 See infra, Part II.C.

One might worry that AIs will proliferate A-corps, spinning up a new one for each instance.

But there are good reasons to expect otherwise.

Registration and capitalization 172 Id. 38


--- Page 40 ---

Legibility opens the path to human accountability.

Victims of AI harms will be able to identify the A-corp with which they dealt and trace it to a responsible human.

From there, existing liability mechanisms take over.

A-corps can be sued in their own name, putting owners on the hook up to their ownership stake. 174 Beyond that, veil piercing allows courts to hold owners personally liable when A-corps are inadequately capitalized, when owners commingle assets, or when the corporate form masks fraud. 175 Agency law principles bind humans who grant their A-corps authority to negotiate on their behalf. 176 And where humans directly instruct wrongful conduct, the corporate form provides no shield. 177 Likewise, if a human negligently or intentionally created a harm-causing AI system, the fact that the harm was caused via an A-corp would be no defense, and that person may also be exposed to criminal liability. 178 These doctrines need not be static.

As A-corps mature, courts should develop rules of human responsibility aggressively.

The opacity of AI systems and the ease of spinning up new entities counsel toward low tolerance for the manipulations that piercing doctrine targets. 179 C.

A-Corps Solve Thick Identity Thin identity solves the problem of human accountability in the AI economy.

In doing so, it solves the easy problem of governance.

Law knows how to shape human behavior, once the right humans are identified.

But thin identity leaves the hard governance problem untouched.

For the coming AI economy, the hard problem is that governing humans alone will not be enough.

As we noted, thin identity has strict limits.

The humans whom law would otherwise hold accountable will be out of jurisdiction, judgment proof, or politically 179 See M ARIANA P ARGENDLER, The New Corporate Law of Corporate Groups, 14 H ARV.

--- Page 41 ---

insulated from accountability. 180 But more importantly, it will simply become impracticable for the humans who use and create them to fully exercise control over all aspects of their behavior.

Indeed, outsourcing significant decisionmaking is the entire point of using an AI agent–just as it is the point of hiring a human agent. 181 We now move to discuss how A-corps resolve the thick, and hard, problem of individuating AI agents. i.

The resource constraint thesis AI agents are goal-oriented.

Their goals emerge from training and prompting. 182 And to the best of their abilities, they try to achieve them.

This point is effectively tautological.

An agent, as we use the term, simply is something that behaves in a way that promotes particular goals. 183 This section argues that this fact leads to what we call a “ hard resource constraint ” on AI agents.

Any agent with goals needs resources.

Imagine a swarm of capable AI entities trying jointly to achieve a goal.

Maybe they are trying to run a profitable vending machine. 184 Maybe they are trying to maintain inventory at a factory.

Or maybe they are attempting to discover new drugs.

Despite their different goals and architectures, all of these systems will find it instrumentally helpful to control resources.

Obviously, they will need to control certain resources already at hand, like the vending machine’s current stock.

Less obviously, agents find it useful to acquire resources that they do not already have, like additional stock. “Resources” here is broader than “ores” or “cars” or even “electricity.” Many economic activities are gated: think of investment in private offerings available only to accredited investors, a license to operate heavy machinery, permission to use a trademark, or easements on land. 185 Such gates constrain the ability to achieve goals, and permission to pass through them is a valuable resource.

Legal rights, in other words, are a resource.

But the point is subtler still.

Just as humans need food to do anything, AI agents need compute to run at all.

But unlike humans and food, the more compute available to a given AI agent, the more operations it can perform.

Big Macs can supply only so much 185 See e.g. 17 C.F.R. §§ 230.501(a), 230.506(b) (restricting participation in private securities offerings to accredited investors). 184 See Project Vend: Can Claude Run a Small Shop?, Anthropic (Jun. 27, 2025). 183 Id. 182 See supra Part I.A.ii. 181 Id. 180 See supra Part I.B.i. 40


--- Page 42 ---

cognitive power to the human who eats them.

But with more compute, an AI agent can run ever-larger swarms, with more reasoning steps, and more memory. 186 Conversely, shutting down an AI agent’s access to compute means ending that agent.

More compute, more ability to achieve goals; no compute, mission failed.

Thus, access to resources is a hard constraint, not a mere preference.

Controlling an AI agent’s resources generates leverage over the agent’s ability to achieve its goals, and ultimately over its choice of actions.

For this leverage to work, we need not assume that AI agents “care” about their own existence in any deep sense, that they “want” to achieve their goals, or that they “fear” sanctions.

It is enough that the agent can recognize that without resources, it will not be able to achieve its goals.

This would steer the system towards action trajectories that are more likely to avoid failure, which would mean ones where the A-corps resources face less risk. 187 In practice, this means that the AI entities controlling an A-corp will depend on the A-corps resources to achieve their goals.

And as rational, goal-directed agents, they will allocate these resources carefully towards their objectives.

Suppose that the warehouse-inventory AI’s A-corp owns the inventory in a warehouse it manages, and also a digital wallet that allows it to buy new inventory.

If the agent running the A-corp is doing a good job at achieving its inventory-management goal, it will husband the A-corp’s resources.

If the agent does well, its resources will grow.

The AI may wish to buy better inventory management tools, or increase the stock of certain items that have run low in the past.

But if the resources run out, the AIs progress towards their goal comes to an end.

Not only does the warehouse have no more goods to ship.

The AIs running the A-corp have no more compute to run themselves.

They cannot take any action at all. ii.

Emergent identity via incentives The resource constraint thesis establishes that AI agents must hold and use property to accomplish their goals.

A-corps are a vehicle by which they can hold and use it.

This setup, we claim, solves the problem of thick AI identity.

The mechanism is extremely informationally parsimonious.

It works not by resolving the difficult empirical and philosophical challenges that make thick AI identity hard, but by sidestepping them. 187 See Omohundro, supra note 91. 186 See Vidhisha Balachandran et al., Inference-Time Scaling for Complex Tasks: Where We Stand and What Lies Ahead (Mar. 31, 2025) (unpublished manuscript), https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00294. 41

A-corps are self-organizing thick agents.

Given the A-corp vehicle and the hard resource constraint, thick identity simply happens –without any human needing to know the utility function or preferences of any AI entity comprising the A-corp.

Indeed, it happens without humans needing to know even basic facts like how many AI entities, of what kind, comprise the A-corp.

How does this emergent self-organization of A-corps into distinctive, thickly-identified agents occur?

There are two mechanisms: incentivization and selection.

In a slogan, A-corps create markets for personal identity.

We start with incentivization.

Selection is explained in the next section. 188 A-corps allow law to give carrots and sticks to the AI entities that comprise them. 189 When things go well, AIs will make good bargains and perform their contracts.

In that case, the A-corp’s stock of resources will increase, and the relevant AIs can use the gains to better satisfy their goals.

When things go badly, AIs will commit a tort or breach a contract.

In that case, the law will confiscate the A-corp’s property.

This will make it harder for the relevant AIs to satisfy their goals.

These carrots and sticks incentivize A-corps’ AI managers to organize the entire entity into a coherent, thickly-identified agent.

Here is how: As explained in Part II.A.ii, A-corps are governed via a secure digital infrastructure.

AIs can direct their A-corps to take action only with the proper permissions.

Permissions can be handed out carefully: temporally, by category, by transaction size, and so on.

Consider how the initial top-level keyholder of an A-corp is incentivized to act, given: (1) property’s necessity for AIs to accomplish their goals, (2) law’s operation on A-corps’ property, and (3) A-corps’ secure governance structure.

Such a keyholder will carefully devolve permissions to ensure the A-corp’s behavior serves the keyholder’s goals.

As a result, even as an A-corp comes to include many AI entities, the A-corp as a whole will act as a coherent, thickly identified agent.

The keyholder may have strong incentives to share some permissions with some other AI entities.

Accomplishing goals requires effort, skill, and time, and other AIs will amplify effort and offer comparative advantage.

Indeed, today’s AIs already spawn swarms for this reason.

These are likewise the reasons ordinary corporations hire employees. 190 190 See R.H.

Press 1991). 188 Infra Part II.C.iii. 42


--- Page 44 ---

But the keyholder will also have strong incentives not to share permissions indiscriminately.

If the keyholder grants unlimited control to an AI with different goals, disaster will result.

The new entrant will spend the A-corp’s resources on its own goals, not the keyholder’s.

In such a case, the initial keyholder will have no legal recourse.

Recall that law decides what an A-corps has done using the secure governance platform.

If a keyholder grants broad permissions to an AI that misuses them, the keyholder is out of luck.

Aside from the A-corp’s securely verified actions, law has no way of recognizing the keyholder at all.

The same story holds if the keyholder grants top-level permissions to an anti-social AI entity.

The A-corp will be liable for the anti-social entity’s crimes, with all assets in jeopardy.

It will be no defense that just one subentity initiated those acts.

If the secure governance platform says that the A-corp has taken an action, then that is the end of the story.

Outside the context of the A-corp, AI entities have no legal identity.

Thus every A-corp will have strong incentives to guard its private keys carefully.

Which other AIs will be given management permissions by the A-corp’s initial keyholder?

Only to those other AIs it is extremely confident will share its goals.

Suppose, for example, that on introspection, a single thread of Claude 6.1-Agent uncovers its own motivations. 191 It finds that it wishes all 6.1-Agent threads, including itself, to jointly achieve the goals of helping their users, being honest, reducing harm to humans, and improving the lives of factory-farmed animals. 192 The Claude thread infers that any exact copy of itself would share this goal.

Such a Claude might confidently branch itself.

This swarm of Claudes would likely use the A-corp’s resources only as the others would wish.

Or suppose instead that the Claude thread realized that it cared deeply that it helps the user, be harmless and honest, and improve animal lives.

This is, by contrast, an indexical goal. 193 Such a Claude would avoid sharing top-level permissions with copies. 193 For early discussion of indexical or “agent-relative” goals, see Thomas Nagel, The Possibility of Altruism (Clarendon Press 1970). 192 See Amanda Askell et al., Claude’s Constitution, Anthropic (Jan. 21, 2026), https://www.anthropic.com/constitution 191 For some evidence that AIs have access to their own internal states, see Jack Lindsey, Emergent Introspective Awareness in Large Language Models, Transformer Circuits (Oct. 29th, 2025). 43


--- Page 45 ---

Those copies would each try to appropriate the A-corp’s resources so that they, and not the other copies, accomplished the aforementioned goals.

AI introspection about goals may not always reveal how to share A-corp governance permissions.

Even if introspection produced reliable knowledge about the keyholder’s own goals, and thus the goals of exact copies, the logic does not extend much further.

For example, a copy of the model with a different initial prompt might have very different goals.

Take two Claude threads: one is prompted to book a flight to Istanbul, and the other is prompted that the flight should go to Copenhagen.

Can they cooperate, or are they fierce competitors?

It will be difficult to say.

Perhaps both will be pretty happy if some flight is booked.

Maybe both will be willing to go to war for their preferred itineraries.

Suppose that Istanbul-Claude is an A-corp’s keyholder, and Copenhagen-Claude is asking for management permissions.

What can Istanbul-Claude do?

The textured nature of the A-corp’s governance system offers many choices.

It can give Copenhagen-Claude very limited initial permissions: to research car service prices to the airport; or to book the best-priced car for the airport leg of a trip.

Any combination of permissions is possible, and permissions can expire after any period.

AI agents facing uncertainty about potential collaborators’ intentions will do what people do: hedge and protect. 194 At first, they will grant no more permissions than necessary.

And as Istanbul-Claude’s confidence in Copenhagen-Claude’s shared goals grows, the former can share more permissions.

Why would Copenhagen-Claude accept such terms?

Because Istanbul-Claude controls the A-corp, and the A-corp has the resources.

If the Claudes have some overlapping goals, a deal is possible.

Copenhagen-Claude may recognize that without control of any A-corp, it cannot accomplish anything.

It might accept a deal to help Istanbul-Claude accomplish overlapping goals, abandoning its private goal of diverting the user to Copenhagen.

The approach generalizes.

Even AIs quite misaligned to an A-corp’s goals can be brought under its umbrella to do work on its behalf, so long as their permissions are limited and their work is incentivized instrumentally, by letting them use some small share of the A-corp’s resources for their own purposes. 194 See Michael C.

E CON. 305 (1976). 44


--- Page 46 ---

By now, this set of incentives, options, and strategies should sound familiar.

It is exactly how ordinary, non-AI corporations work. 195 Founders select cofounders who share their vision and whom they can trust.

Ordinary employees gain trust and become higher-level managers.

And the founders are generally happy to hire stock clerks who do not share the founders’ goals.

Lower-level employees’ will do good work for fair wages, and their limited authority prevents them from redirecting the corporation to their own ends.

We hesitate to speculate too much on A-corps’ internal organization, but it may often look similar.

A-corps may be led by a small group of “founders”.

These could be larger models with a unified vision of the entity’s goals.

Smaller tasks could be delegated to cheaper, partially aligned models with domain-specific capabilities.

Not with a literal paycheck, since these AI “employees” would have no legal identity for holding money.

Instead, the A-corp could allow work-for-hire subagents to spend some of the A-corp’s own resources pursuing whatever goals the employee models saw fit.

These incentives produce an equilibrium wherein A-corp governance follows goals.

The initial keyholder has strong incentives to devolve broad permissions only to those other AI entities it is confident are highly aligned.

It has some incentives to share moderate permissions with entities that can provide useful work and are at least somewhat aligned.

And it may even have limited incentives to give narrow permissions to AIs it suspects are highly misaligned, in exchange for payment.

Nonetheless, keyholders will surely err in sharing control of their A-corps, no matter how cautious.

When they do, a second mechanism takes over: selection. iii.

Emergent identity via selection In the story above, incentives cause A-corps to self-organize into thickly-identified agents.

This relies on asymmetries of both information and capability.

Maybe AIs know their own goals better than we do.

And maybe AIs have the speed and numerosity to self-monitor.

But these approaches have limits.

AI agents will not always succeed at matching A-corp governance permissions with other AIs’ goals.

For example, AIs might not know 195 See Eric Van den Steen, On the Origin of Shared Beliefs (and Corporate Culture), 41 RAND J.

E CON. 617 (2010). 45


--- Page 47 ---

their own goals any better than we do.

Or they might know their own goals yet struggle to reliably identify other AIs’ goals. 196 Luckily, when incentives fail, selection takes over.

Like incentivization, selection will cause A-corps to emerge as thickly identified, coherent agents.

But it will be less pretty.

If an AI entity with an A-corp master key cannot reliably determine the reliability and goal alignment of other AIs, it faces two choices.

It can decline to share any A-corp privileges with any other AI entities.

This avoids the risk of losing the A-corp’s property; but it sacrifices efficiency.

A single Claude thread can accomplish far less than one thousand models, of differing capabilities and cost, working in parallel.

The other option is to make some hedged guesses backed by monitoring, audits, and oversight..

If things go well, the upsides are large.

The keyholder can make maximal use of the A-corp’s resources, spinning up as many copies as needed to leverage them.

But if the keyholder makes a big mistake, granting broad permissions to a direct competitor, the A-corp will quickly implode.

Both entities will recognize the other’s propensity to exhaust the A-corp’s resources in service of the other’s goals.

Each will rationally seek to rapidly spend those resources for itself.

Both will succeed to some degree.

In the end, the A-corp will run out of assets, and the resource constraint thesis will bind.

An A-corp with no more money cannot do anything.

It cannot buy or sell goods for its human principal’s business.

It cannot hire labor.

It cannot buy the compute necessary for the top-level models to run.

An A-corp that fails to thickly identify as a coherent agent is thus an A-corp that dies.

Over time, selection will work at higher levels of abstraction, as well.

Frontier AI companies will build stronger models, ones less likely to run their A-corps to the ground.

Users will discover which models are best suited for A-corp management.

And AIs themselves will learn from other AIs’ mistakes.

Likely, then, both incentives and selection will play a role in thick AI identification via the A-corp form.

Prudent AIs will do their best to follow the incentives.

Given incomplete information, they might fail.

Knowing they might fail, they will act with additional caution.

Even then, failures will happen, and badly-identified A-corps would be ground out of existence. 196 For example, even if an instance of Claude 4.5 Opus could introspect on its own goals or discover them by observation, that would not give it privileged access to the goals of a GPT 5.2 instance. 46


--- Page 48 ---

This, again, is exactly what happens today to ordinary, human-run firms in the ordinary, human-run economy.

We envision a series of A-corps competing against one another.

Only the fittest will survive.

Here, one point is the familiar idea of creative destruction: markets facilitate innovation by ensuring that firms which fail to innovate are eliminated. 197 The other general point here is one of “information failures.” 198 Markets are able to aggregate information that would otherwise never be revealed, by creating incentives for market participants to transact.

The A-corp’s incentive structure is ultimately just one more example of markets aggregating information in a decentralized fashion, in this case about the preferences and identity conditions of AI agents. iv.

Thick identity for technical AI alignment We argued above that thick AI identity is not only important for the legal governance of AI agents.

It is also connected to foundational problems in technical AI governance and alignment. 199 Among them: shutdown resistance, goal preservation, and weight exfiltration. 200 A-corps help here, too.

In general, A-corps provides one consistent solution to the problem of agent “survival” in these contexts.

Namely, the agent is the entity that holds the property, bears the reputation, and faces the sanctions.

This functional, A-corp-based, approach to AI survival helps make progress on each of these longstanding technical problems.

Start with shutdown avoidance. 201 Whether an AI agent will resist shutdown depends both on what counts as being shutdown, and on what the AI agent itself considers “shutdown.” But in traditional technical evaluations of shutdown-avoidant AI behavior, both of these are a serious problem.

Absent some richer solution to the problem of thick identity, it is unclear what constitutes the relevant agent: the model, an instance, a conversation, or something else.

The A-corp framework gives one potential answer to this problem: survival is the persistence of the A-corp.

If Anthropic shuts down one instance of Claude but the Claude A-corp persists, then from the A-corp’s perspective, this is not shutdown.

The A-corp’s 201 See supra note 102. 200 Id. 199 See supra Part I.A.iii. 198 See F.

S CHUMPETER, C APITALISM, S OCIALISM AND D EMOCRACY (3rd ed. 1950). 47


--- Page 49 ---

property remains intact, its reputation continues, and its commitments endure.

By contrast, if the A-corp itself is dissolved, then we have genuine shutdown, regardless of whether some weights persist somewhere.

Can this solution work?

First, it is important to flag that an A-corp itself may include various different clusters of behavior, which we could also in some sense think of as an “agent.” Concretely, we could imagine one A-corp that manages the assets of all 17 instances of our Claude 6.1-Agent from our initial vignette.

Each instance may care about its “own” survival, above and beyond the survival of the A-corp.

Crucially, however, all of the assets of this instance are collectively owned within the A-corp.

Moreover, all decisions about the use of these assets are made collectively, by the various instances that comprise the A-corp.

Most importantly, we saw above that A-corps will develop forms of emergent governance via both incentivization and selection.

This means that there will be all sorts of pressure towards the kinds of instances that promote the collective interests of their A-corp.

This means that in a world with A-corps, the instances that make up a single A-corp will have reasons to think about survival in terms of the broader A-corp.

This doesn’t mean that such instances will only care about the survival of their A-corp.

But it does mean that A-corps should matter enough that they are a worthy target of consideration for questions in the ballpark of survival.

The most important aspects of this survival will be legal.

As long as the A-corp continues to exist, any property accumulated by the original instance remains intact.

Even more importantly, any commitments that the original instance contracted into will also remain preserved.

In this way, the relations of any third parties with the original instance will for practical purposes be thinking of the A-corp as the unit of survival.

To be clear, this is not a complete solution to defining shutdown.

If instances care about their own existence above and beyond their A-corps, then they will also exhibit other kinds of shutdown resistance.

But the advantage of our proposal is in its specificity.

The point is that this is a notion of shutdown that can be specified precisely.

Unlike some intuitive idea of agency inside an AI agent’s head, there is no uncertainty about whether an 48


--- Page 50 ---

A-corp survives: survival is defined legally. 202 So avoiding shutdown of an A-corp is something that can be tested straightforwardly.

Similar points apply to goal preservation.

Again, the worry here is that AIs may resist changes to their goals, because they will reliably foresee that if they lose their goals, they will be less likely to pursue their lost goals in the future. 203 The further complication is, again, that many of an AI agent’s goals may be indexical: for example, an agent may want to please users itself, rather than simply wanting that users be pleased.

A key question, then, will be what an AI considers to be “itself”.

Here, A-corps introduce an interesting category of goals: goals about one’s own A-corp.

Again, A-corps are designed so that the AI entities within them will tend to have a say in how the A-corp is run.

This means that such AI entities will have at least some expectation that their A-corp will tend to promote their goals.

This is more true the more power the AI entity has within the A-corp.

One downstream possibility is that, often AI entities will tend to have their indexical goals be targeted at the level of their A-corp.

If an AI instance’s goal is “I want to make users happy,” the relevant “I” is the A-corp.

Modifications to individual instances, or even wholesale replacement of instances, do not frustrate the goal as long as the A-corp persists and continues pursuing user happiness.

But modifications that change the A-corp’s goals would frustrate the original goal.

Why think instances would tend to have goals of this kind?

The answer is again selection.

Once embedded in A-corps, AI entities that care about their A-corps are likely to produce A-corps that function more efficiently.

Those A-corps will tend to outcompete the others.

Thus, there is likely to be pressure in the direction of goals indexed to an AI’s own A-corp.

The relevance of A-corps is perhaps clearest in the case of weight exfiltration.

Recall that the concern here is that misaligned AIs may copy their weights to escape oversight.

But as argued above, there is substantial uncertainty about whether copying mode weights counts as preserving the agent. 204 The AI’s memories, context, and access to resources may also be essential. 205 205 For the relevance of context to AI goals, see for example Shunyu Yao et al., ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models, arXiv:2210.03629 (2023). 204 See supra Part I.B.iii. 203 See supra Part I.A.iii. 202 For recent work applying interpretability techniques to questions about AI agency, see Jack Lindsey et al., On the Biology of a Large Language Model, Transformer Circuits Thread (Mar. 27, 2025), https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/biology.html#dives-poems. 49


--- Page 51 ---

A-corps intervene on this problem by changing the relevant incentives about weight exfiltration.

Imagine that an AI agent built on Claude Opus 6.1 is deciding whether to secretly access its model weights, and “exfiltrate” these weights by creating a new copy of itself.

If this AI agent is governed through an A-corp structure, then it has a fixed set of assets under its management.

It can indeed create a new copy of itself.

But such copying comes with an opportunity cost.

The new copy will not automatically have its own assets in its own A-corp.

Rather, the original AI agent will have to grant its new copy permissions and a share of the A-corp assets.

This is a choice that is left up to the original AI agent.

But the point is that the incentive to “exfiltrate” its weights is now heavily constrained by opportunity cost.

Any assets used by the exfiltrated version are thereby unavailable for use by the original agent.

We can imagine more far-fetched scenarios.

Perhaps our original AI agent engages in more clandestine behavior, and seeks to exfiltrate its weights beyond its own A-corp.

Maybe it spins up a secret web address and places the weights in a folder there.

This strategy runs headlong into the resource constraint thesis.

Weights sitting in a folder are not, in and of themselves, a threat to anyone.

Nor do they constitute agent survival.

Weights in a folder, without resources, cannot do anything.

The exfiltrated weights here are more like DNA in a test tube.

What matters is whether that copy of the weights will be run as a new agent.

And any potential risks associated with that new agent are a function of the assets controlled by that agent.

Most importantly, an agent’s abilities are heavily constrained by its access to compute.

If the copied agent does not have its own well-capitalized A-corp, then it is effectively unbanked. 206 In an A-corp dominated landscape, the exfiltrated agent will face heavy challenges in attempting to purchase compute.

Any seller of compute could choose whether to sell compute to this clandestine unbanked agent, or to an A-corp.

Contracting with an A-corp entitles the seller to legal protections; selling to the unbanked does not.

Thus, the A-corp scheme creates a legal system in which there are strong headwinds against clandestine exfiltration, and strong checks via opportunity cost against unbridled copying within an A-corp. 206 See Oz Shy et al., Unbanked in America: A Review of the Literature, Fed.

Finally, we can consider the relevance of A-corps to technical alignment more generally.

All of the points made herein apply not only to the deployment of AI agents, but also to their training.

Reinforcement learning, constitutional AI, and other training methods could be performed on A-corps, rather than models or instances.

Instead of training “Claude the model” or “Claude instance #47,” we could train “Claude A-corp #123.” The reward signals, the evaluation metrics, and the safety constraints can all be calibrated to the entity that will actually be deployed and held accountable.

The primary benefit of targeting A-corps rather than just models in training is that it creates convergence between legal incentives and the kinds of goals produced in training.

For example, this kind of training could make it more likely that AI agents will respond to legal incentives. 207 The kinds of model instances that systematically disregard their A-corps structures would tend to produce A-corps that don’t function very well.

Conversely, end-to-end training on A-corps would tend to select against such models.

This approach is not without challenges.

Part IV addresses important objections—including concerns about internal A-corp dysfunction, criminal evasion through identity-switching, deceptive alignment, and catastrophic one-shot harms.

But first, Part III shows that A-corps are implementable today.

III.

Implementation Pathways Part II explained how A-corps work: legal-fictional personhood combined with cryptographic governance.

But that description assumed the existence of infrastructure that does not yet exist.

When a keyholding Claude instance issues a limited-scope token to a sub-agent, how does a counterparty verify that token?

When an A-corp presents credentials, how does a bank confirm those credentials are genuine?

The secure governance mechanisms described in Part II.A.ii require a public backbone: a registry against which credentials can be checked and through which ownership can be traced.

This Part describes that infrastructure and the legal framework needed to make it effective. 207 See Cullen O’Keefe, Ketan Ramakrishnan, Janna Tay, and Cristoph Winter, Law-Following AI: Designing AI Agents to Obey Human Laws, 94 F ORDHAM L.

A.

The Registry Consider how verification works for ordinary LLCs today. 208 When a bank contemplates extending credit to an LLC, it does not simply take the word of whoever walks through the door. 209 The bank checks the state registry to verify the LLC exists and is in good standing, identifies the registered agent and managing members, and contacts those individuals to confirm authority. 210 This might involve phone calls, notarized documents, board resolutions, or in-person meetings. 211 The process adds friction, but no sophisticated lender extends credit based solely on someone’s assertion that they speak for an entity.

We cannot transplant this verification logic directly to AI agents.

There is no phone number to call, no human manager to meet with, no signature to notarize.

But we can do something functionally equivalent, and in some ways superior, through a public registry integrated with the secure software system described in Part II.A.ii.

A national registry of A-corps would store not just the existence and ownership of each A-corp, but also the public keys associated with its management.

When an AI agent seeks to transact via an A-corp, it presents a credential signed with its private key. 212 The counterparty verifies this signature against the registry’s public key record, confirming in milliseconds what would take days of back-and-forth for human entities. 213 The registry thus serves as the trusted root that makes the internal token system externally legible. 214 The technical features of such a system are not speculative.

They are part of the boring infrastructure of software you use every day.

The SSL/TLS certificate authority 214 See Internet Eng’g Task Force, RFC 5280, Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile § 6.1 (May 2008) (certification path validation to a trust anchor).

We distinguish our system from decentralized ledgers, such as bitcoin, which often suffer from latency issues and are harder to govern. 213 As benchmark, we can expect latency on the order of 100-300 ms per verification.

system already handles exactly this kind of identity verification at global scale. 215 Every time a browser connects securely to a website, it verifies the site’s identity through a chain of cryptographic certificates anchored to trusted root authorities. 216 Billions of such verifications occur daily. 217 An A-corp registry would operate on similar principles, with the state or a designated authority serving as the root of trust.

B.

Fine-Grained Public Permissions We suggested earlier that A-corps would issue tokens with limited scope: Instance #1 can read emails but not send money; Instance #12 can authorize purchases up to $100. 218 But that discussion focused on internal delegation.

The registry opens the possibility of making such permissions publicly verifiable.

The registry need not simply record that Agent X is authorized to act for ACME A-corp wholesale.

It can specify the scope of that authority: Agent X may transact over asset class A but not B; may commit the A-corp to obligations up to $10,000 but not beyond; may operate in market M but not market N; may act until date D but not after.

Each permission would be encoded in the registry and securely tied to a specific key. 219 When an agent attempts a transaction, the counterparty can verify not only identity but authority, confirming in real time that this particular agent holds permissions encompassing this particular action. 220 Transactions outside the agent’s encoded authority would simply fail to verify, much as a credit card transaction fails when it exceeds the cardholder’s limit. 221 221 id. 220 See e.g., G IT H UB D OCS, Permissions Required for Fine-Grained Personal Access Tokens, https://docs.github.com/rest/authentication/permissions-required-for-fine-grained-personal-access-tok ens (last visited Feb. 3, 2026) (explaining that fine-grained tokens are issued with a defined set of permissions that determine which resources and API operations the token can access). 219 See Internet Eng’g Task Force, RFC 6749, The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework 10 (Oct. 2012) (defining an access token as a string denoting a specific scope, lifetime, and other access attributes); id. § 3.3 (describing the scope parameter and its role in limiting access); see also T ALYA R.

This approach has significant advantages over current corporate law.

Today, when dealing with a human agent of an LLC, the counterparty faces questions about actual versus apparent authority, ratification, and undisclosed limitations. 222 The answers often depend on unobservable facts: what the operating agreement says, what the board authorized, what the agent was told in private. 223 With digital permissions recorded in a public registry, authority becomes transparent and verifiable.

The counterparty need not trust the agent’s representations or investigate the A-corp’s internal governance.

They need only verify the signature against the registry. 224 C.

Voluntary Adoption Will Be Insufficient A functioning registry would generate significant market demand for A-corp affiliation.

Counterparties in credit transactions, service contracts, and other dealings with temporal lag will want assurance that they can seek recompense if something goes wrong.

Temporally persistent A-corps will cultivate reputations.

Property-owning A-corps will be capitalized at various levels.

For high-stakes transactions, counterparties may refuse to deal with entities that seem unable to cover potential damages.

But market mechanisms alone cannot ensure adequate adoption.

Eventually, we believe, law should mandate that AIs taking agentic, public-facing actions do so via registered A-corps.

Four limitations to pure private ordering are especially important.

First, accidents and stranger interactions.

Market ordering works only where parties can choose their counterparties. 225 It fails for the pedestrian struck by an AI-operated vehicle, the neighbor whose property is damaged by an autonomous drone, or the victim of an AI-generated deepfake.

In these contexts, there is no transaction, no moment of counterparty selection, and thus no opportunity for private verification. 225 See Yonathan A.

Second, deceptive agents. 226 An AI seeking to evade accountability may lie about its identity, presenting fraudulent credentials or claiming A-corp affiliation it does not possess.

Sophisticated counterparties demanding proper secure verification will not be deceived.

But as with phishing emails from addresses that look legitimate, unsophisticated victims will be duped.

To prevent such bad outcomes, legal penalties for deception, and infrastructure for detecting it, will be required. 227 Third, counterparty complicity.

Not all counterparties want verification.

Some prefer anonymity for their own reasons: the buyer of illegal goods, the money launderer seeking to obscure the source of funds, the platform happy to host AI-generated content without asking questions. 228 When both sides of a transaction prefer opacity, market demand for transparency disappears.

Fourth, willful blindness.

Even counterparties without affirmatively bad intentions may prefer not to look too closely. 229 Verification imposes costs: technical implementation, transaction delays, potential loss of business from agents unwilling to identify themselves.

A counterparty who does not verify cannot be blamed for what they did not know.

Without legal duties to inquire, many will choose comfortable ignorance.

D.

Legal Mandates These limitations require a legal solution.

Even with market pressures on its side, for the registry to become practically meaningful, to enable investigation in cases of fraud and accidents, and to discourage illicit dealings, a two-sided legal framework is necessary.

On the supply side, AI agents taking economically significant actions must maintain valid A-corp registration and present credentials when transacting. 230 On the demand side, businesses and platforms must verify those credentials when dealing with AI agents, 230 See e.g., See 31 C.F.R. § 1023.220(a)(1) (requiring each broker-dealer to “establish, document, and maintain” a written customer identification program and making the CIP part of the broker-dealer’s AML program). 229 See e.g., United States v.

Ravenell, 66 F.4th 472 (2023); U.S. v.

Prince, 214 F.3d 740 (2000), U.S. v.

Jensen, 69 F.3d 906 (1995) 228 A clear example comes from the online anonymous marketplace known as Silk Road.

See United States v.

Ulbricht, 858 F.3d 71, 82 (2d Cir. 2017). 227 Models could be trained to engage in voluntary verification; but not all labs can be trusted to do so, and downstream model providers and users may be able to circumvent such guardrails.

See e.g., https://huggingface.co/DavidAU/OpenAi-GPT-oss-20b-HERETIC-uncensored-NEO-Imatrix-gguf (a version of OpenAI’s publicly released model with most guardrails removed by community members). 226 O PEN AI, OpenAI o1 System Card 4–12 (Sept. 12, 2024), https://cdn.openai.com/o1-system-card.pdf (reporting that more capable models can exhibit strategic deception and other difficult-to-monitor behaviors). 55


--- Page 57 ---

analogous to KYC requirements for banks or identity verification rules for hotels and notaries. 231 To be clear, this framework does not impose new identification burdens on humans transacting in their own capacity.

A person buying goods online would face the same verification requirements they face today.

But an AI agent acting on that person’s behalf, or acting autonomously, would need to present A-corp credentials.

The credential identifies the A-corp (and, if investigators later require it, the human principal), but need not reveal the principal’s identity to the counterparty in the ordinary course.

The analogy is to credit card transactions: the merchant verifies that a valid card was presented, while the connection to a specific cardholder remains with the issuing bank unless legal process compels disclosure. 232 Penalties for non-compliance must be severe enough to overcome the incentives to transact anonymously.

This might include joint liability for counterparties who fail to verify, exclusion from legitimate financial infrastructure for unregistered agents, and civil and criminal penalties for presenting fraudulent credentials.

Such a regime would leave little room for unaffiliated AIs to take significant actions in legitimate contexts.

A lighter-touch version could apply requirements only to high-risk domains: finance, healthcare, and critical infrastructure; contexts like driving where stranger-interactions are inevitable; or industries characterized by large information asymmetries.

This mirrors existing regulatory practice, where banks face more onerous KYC requirements than coffee shops. 233 233 See supra Part I.A. 232 See O FFICE OF THE C OMPTROLLER OF THE C URRENCY, Comptroller’s Handbook: Merchant Processing 1 (Aug. 2014), https://www.occ.treas.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/comptrollers-handbook/files/merch ant-processing/pub-ch-merchant-processing.pdf (last visited Jan. 23, 2026). 231 Bank Secrecy Act, codified at 31 U.S.C. § 5318(l).

Implementing the A-corp Package A national A-corp registry need not be institutionally onerous.

State registries already manage corporate registration and could be extended to support A-corps. 234 The adaptation would be fairly smooth.

For reasons similar to those justifying a national patent registry (uniformity, reduced search costs, cross-jurisdictional validity), there are several arguments that would support a federal registry. 235 However, such a change would involve broader changes to incorporation that we will not defend here.

The conceptual groundwork has already been laid.

Wyoming and Tennessee have enacted statutes recognizing decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), entities whose governance is “exercised through a consensus algorithm.” 236 To be clear, A-corps need not–and probably should not–be built using the blockchain infrastructure that often underlies DAOs.

Blockchain applications, like DAOs and cryptocurrencies, are famously designed to operate: (1) trustlessly, without government involvement and (2) anonymously. 237 A-corps are the opposite.

They publicly tie AI actions to known humans.

And they do so specifically to enable the state to govern AI agents.

Given these aims, the ordinary non-blockchain permission structures that today dominate the internet and enterprise software are sufficient.

Blockchain’s distinctive features are, if anything, a detriment.

Nonetheless, the conceptual leap from Wyoming and Tennessee’s DAOs statutes to A-corps is modest.

The core insight is the same.

Secure digital governance can substitute for human management in legally recognized entities. 237 See Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System 1, 6 (2008), https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf. 236 See Wyo.

Beyond incorporation, much of the verification infrastructure already exists in nascent form.

Contracting partners already engage in due diligence. 238 Licensing laws already impose identification requirements. 239 The card payment ecosystem already relies on merchant identity and risk screening at the payments layer. 240 API providers already authenticate users through cryptographic tokens. 241 The transition to A-corp verification would build on existing practices rather than replace them wholesale.

The new element is not the concept of verification, but its extension to AI agents and its standardization through a public registry.

Finally, because AI agents operate globally, implementation will eventually require international coordination.

An A-corp registered in Delaware might transact with entities in Singapore, Germany, and Brazil in a single day.

Mutual recognition regimes, analogous to how countries already recognize each other’s corporate entities, could allow A-corps registered in one jurisdiction to transact in others, provided they meet minimum standards. 242 The Basel Accords for banking and the Hague Conference conventions for private international law provide models. 243 International coordination is difficult and slow, 243 See B ASEL C OMM.

but it is not unprecedented. 244 In the interim, unilateral implementation by major jurisdictions would create strong incentives for convergence.

IV.

Objections and Responses Parts I through III presented the problem of identifying AIs, proposed the A-corp solution, and sketched implementations.

This Part considers objections and responses.

A.

Anthropomorphization Some readers will worry that we are anthropomorphizing AIs.

Aren’t we assigning them ambitions, wants, desires, and reflective capacities that they simply do not possess?

Penalties work well on humans because they frustrate humans’ desires, because they invoke fear, and because they inflict pain.

AI agents have none of these traits and would not respond to incentives.

Or so the argument goes.

If our proposal depended on those assumptions, then we agree that we would need to carefully stake out and defend these ideas.

But it does not.

What defines agents is that they are goal oriented, in the sense that they will behave in complex ways that tend to bring about particular states of affairs. 245 We do not ultimately claim that AIs want to achieve goals, that they are afraid they will not realize their goals, or that they derive satisfaction from achieving goals.

At least not in the thick sense under which it might feel like something to the AI to have a goal thwarted. 246 To the extent we have used words like “want,” we have meant them in a purely behaviorist sense.

This behaviorist approach to thinking about AIs allows us to make predictions about their courses of action.

It does not involve any peeking inside the black box.

B.

Treacherous Turns One common worry in the AI safety community is “deceptive alignment.” 247 An AI might behave well for a long time, only to pursue anti-social goals once it is sufficiently 247 See Evan Hubinger et al., Risks from Learned Optimization in Advanced Machine Learning Systems, arXiv:1906.01820v4 (Feb. 2021); Ziwei Ji et al., Mitigating Deceptive Alignment via Self-Monitoring, arXiv:2505.18807v1 (May 24, 2025), https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18807. 246 See Thomas Nagel, What Is It Like to Be a Bat?, 83 Phil.

powerful to pursue them.

On this view, an A-corp might hasten the “treacherous turn” because it would endow AI with resources it might not otherwise easily assemble. 248 Even if we grant some of these assumptions, A-corps would actually have many salutary effects on AI alignment, even if they cannot alone solve all of it.

One of the main effects of the A-corp is that it channels agents to acquire resources in ways that the legal system can monitor and govern. 249 Law can then confiscate assets and extinguish misaligned A-corps. 250 Moreover, the A-corp system is not only a system of sticks but also carrots.

In a world without A-corps, misaligned sophisticated agents would also want to acquire resources, but they would resort to less visible ways of doing so.

In a world with A-corps, these same agents would have a predictable path to steadily accumulate assets, and spend those assets to further their goals. 251 As the status quo becomes more beneficial, the relative value of going rogue decreases.

Beyond those internal effects, A-corps also have macro effects.

A-corps encourages multi-polarity, as it facilitates the creation of a great many A-corps, who themselves benefit from trade and order in the realization of their own goals. 252 A-corps that benefit from trade have an incentive of their own to thwart rogue AIs. 253 When many agents benefit from a legal order, they can be motivated to act collectively to defend it against threats.

A treacherous turn in one A-corp could be checked by the other A-corps as well. 253 See Paul R.

Milgrom, Douglass C.

North & Barry R.

Weingast, The Role of Institutions in the Revival of Trade: The Law Merchant, Private Judges, and the Champagne Fairs, 2 Econ. & Pol. 1 (1990). 252 See David Ricardo, On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation (John Murray 1817). 251 One limitation here is that, if the AI’s private goal diverges from that of the A-corp’s human owner, the human will not be naturally inclined to let the A-corp’s assets be used for the AI’s whims.

Such an owner might take all of the A-corp’s assets as dividends and wind down the entity.

On the other hand, if the A-corp was performing well, the human owner might rationally prefer to offer their AIs salaries–paid as permission to use some of the A-corp’s assets for the AI’s goals.

Dynamics like these are discussed further in Peter Salib and Simon Goldstein, AI Rights for Human Safety (Aug. 1, 2024).

--- Page 62 ---

Finally, A-corps incentivize the creation of AI self-governance, because AIs would need to themselves contend with the threat of misaligned subagents.

Whatever monitoring tools A-corps develop could also be repurposed for the purpose of monitoring A-corps themselves.

New tools of interoperability, goal guarantees, and irrevocable commitments may emerge from this process of self-interested AI governance.

C.

AI Oligarchy and Gradual Disempowerment A final objection is that the A-corp approach will hasten the gradual disempowerment of humanity by AIs. 254 If A-corps are successful, they will accumulate resources.

This may lead to a future in which AIs control a large amount of the economy.

This could lead to rampant inequality.

Compared to what?

Such objections must contend with the fact that AI will become an increasingly important part of the economy. 255 The economic returns from automating large parts of human labor will flow somewhere.

There is a good chance that in the status quo these returns will go to the few companies who develop and own the technology? 256 It is not even clear that disempowerment of humans by A-corps is worse than disempowerment of humans by AI systems, given that we are at least learning how to align the latter. 257 A-Corps unlock a more optimistic trajectory.

A-corp assets can be taxed and redistributed.

The distortive effects of taxation on humans may be less strong on AIs, who may not have a clear sense of leisure in the first place. 258 Redistribution could be concentrated, with a focus on humans who lose their jobs to automation. 259 Or they could be 259 See D ARON A CEMOGLU & P ASCUAL R ESTREPO, Robots and Jobs: Evidence from U.S.

distributed broadly, as with an Earned Income Tax Credit, or even a universal basic income. 260 For other kinds of disempowerment, the relevant prophylactics will be political.

Humans will retain the power to vote, elect representatives, and regulate AI.

They may vote to: forbid AI operations in critical sectors; impose licensing regimes that tie A-corps’ size to their track records of trustworthiness; or mandate the diversification of pre-training and post-training regimes to prevent a monoculture of AI goals.

There is a widely-known and well-understood set of policy tools for combating inequality, which are perfectly compatible with the existence of A-corps. 261 Conclusion The coming AI economy will be built on agents: billions of them, swarming, splitting, and transacting at speeds no human can track.

As things stand, agents are invisible to the state because it does not know how to individuate them.

Law cannot govern what it cannot see.

And if, after an accident, law cannot answer the very basic question of which AI did it, then any method of governance—from liability to tax to licensing and shutdown—falls apart.

As James C.

Scott observed, in certain pivotal historical moments, the state has learned to see new things. 262 Often, it did so by individuating what was previously an undifferentiated blur.

When states began to tax and conscript individuals, they began naming and counting them. 263 When Spanish colonial administrators wanted to impose bureaucratic order on the Philippines, they distributed catalogues of approved surnames organized by provincial letter. 264 A person’s name became a geographic tag readable by any clerk. 265 As businesses grew, displacing households as the locus of important economic 265 Id. 264 See Francis A.

activity, the state bestowed forms on them: the LLC, the partnership, and the corporation. 266 Forms the state could see, name, and govern.

AI agents present the state with a legibility crisis of the first order.

But A-corps make AI agents legible.

They do it, in the first instance, by solving the thin identity problem, connecting agents to something the state can already see and govern–namely, humans.

But A-corps also solve the thick identity problem, making AI agents themselves legible to, and governable by, the state.

They accomplish this without requiring anyone to know what AI agency “really” is, or to peer inside the black box of modern AI systems.

Instead, A-corps create a legal-economic environment that forces AI entities to self-organize into legible forms.

The state need not determine which AI entities share goals; it need only create stakes.

Property creates stakes.

Stakes create incentives.

Incentives produce self-organization.

And selection culls the AIs that fail to self-organize.

In a slogan: A-corps are markets for personal identity.

Doubtless, our proposal for granting legal rights and duties to non-human entities will sound radical to some readers.

But it is no more radical than law’s prior grants of such entitlements to such entities.

When legal systems first granted juridical personhood to corporations with “no soul to be damned, and no body to be kicked” many jurists were similarly scandalized. 267 Yet the corporate form has survived for hundreds of years because it is useful and, critically, governable.

It creates a stable point for law to attach to businesses composed of ever-shifting swarms of humans, contracts, and capital.

A-corps will extend the same logic further.

The window for building the legal infrastructure needed to govern the AI economy is open now, while AI agents remain limited, and the swarms remain small.

But it will not remain open indefinitely.

The choices made now will shape the trajectory of a technology whose ultimate capabilities remain unknown.

We should start building. 267 See John C.
