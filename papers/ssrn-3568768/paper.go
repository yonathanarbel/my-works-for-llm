1.  ## TL;DR ≤100 words
    Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that traditional consumer protection, thought to rely on an "informed minority" reading contracts, is ineffective. Instead, a new type of activist, the "nudnik" or "crusading minority," drives market discipline. Motivated by moral outrage and a sense of justice rather than contract details, nudniks use public shaming, complaints, and lawsuits to punish firms for perceived wrongdoings. These actions create broad benefits, making nudniks the "unsung heroes" of consumer markets, even if their individual motivations or actions can sometimes be controversial.

    *   **Debunking Traditional Consumer Protection Theories**
        Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the long-held "informed minority theory," suggesting a few knowledgeable consumers discipline markets by reading contracts, is unrealistic and empirically challenged. He notes consumers are often rationally apathetic or unable to understand complex terms, leading to passivity. Furthermore, theories of reputational discipline through online reviews are criticized as underspecified, failing to explain how credible information is produced or disseminated, and often relying on biased or low-participation data. These traditional models inadequately explain consumer power in modern markets, prompting a search for alternative explanations.

    *   **Introducing the "Nudnik" - A New Model of Consumer Activism**
        Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a new "crusading minority," termed "nudniks," is emerging as a key force in consumer governance. Unlike the supposed "informed minority," nudniks are motivated less by informing others and more by moral outrage, seeking to punish firms for perceived wrongdoings. They operate *ex post*, reacting to disappointments through complaints, reviews, and litigation, often leveraging the internet. This nudnik-driven activism challenges traditional theories by suggesting that consumer power can be effective even when consumers don't read contracts, as sellers are incentivized to improve quality for all to avoid public disputes.

    *   **Nudniks vs. Other Consumer Archetypes**
        Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that "nudniks"—consumers highly prone to vindicating their rights—are distinct from other archetypes. "Passivists," the largest group, are largely inactive. "Shoppers" meticulously compare terms *ex ante* and primarily "exit" to competitors. "Sophisticates" strategically leverage contract terms for personal profit based on cost-benefit analysis. In contrast, nudniks act *ex post* out of principle or moral outrage, often when others would not, and their actions are more likely to generate positive spillovers for all consumers, whereas sophisticates primarily seek private gains that may not benefit, or could even harm, others.

    *   **Motivations, Methods, and Impact of Nudniks**
        Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nudniks are driven by an innate sense of justice or idiosyncratic motivations, leading them to act even when costs seem to outweigh benefits for an average consumer. They employ tactics like complaints, reviews, lawsuits, and viral social media campaigns (e.g., "United Breaks Guitars") to highlight seller failures. This activism, based on broad transactional expectations rather than specific contract terms, can be initiated by a single individual and amplified by social media. Sellers respond due to legal and reputational risks, often improving service for all, making nudniks effective at solving collective action problems.

    *   **Addressing Criticisms and Nuances of Nudnik Activism**
        Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while nudnik activism is potent, it's not without concerns. Critics question if complaints are always representative or beneficial, potentially being frivolous or driven by unrealistic expectations. However, he argues these issues may be overstated. Nudniks are a heterogeneous group, and their actions, even if driven by "spite," often highlight genuine consumer interests and can lead to market-wide improvements. The impact of unrepresentative nudniks is also mitigated as other consumers tend to amplify only those grievances they find valid, and sellers actively manage expectations.

    *   **Conclusion: The Unsung Heroes of Consumer Markets**
        Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that despite potential downsides, "nudniks" or "crusading consumers" generally have a net positive social impact, filling an important gap in marketplace discipline left by the failure of traditional theories. He posits that focusing on these persistent individuals reveals how a minority can effectively pressure sellers to improve services for all, through legal and reputational incentives. Consequently, legal literature should shift focus from the "informed minority" to these "nudniks," who, despite often facing negative perceptions, serve as the "unsung heroes" of consumer markets, though more research is needed.

    *   **A Note on Cost-Plus No-Fee (CPNF) Contracting**
        Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that, in discussing mechanisms of accountability, Cost-Plus No-Fee (CPNF) contracting offers an interesting parallel. This model challenges traditional contract theory by having agents work at cost, relying on trust and reputational mechanisms instead of explicit profit incentives. He suggests CPNF can function as an "information-forcing" mechanism. By compelling agents to be transparent about their costs and efforts, CPNF helps mitigate issues of asymmetric information often found in principal-agent relationships, echoing themes of trust and non-standard incentives relevant to market governance.`

以下是根据所提供要点对约纳坦·阿尔贝尔（Yonathan Arbel）教授的论文《SSRN-3568768》（“‘较真者’：消费者行动主义的新经济学”）的摘要：

1.  ## 核心观点摘要（100词以内）
    阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔贝尔教授认为，传统消费者保护机制依赖于少数“知情者”阅读合同，但这种机制是无效的。相反，一种新型活动家，即“较真者”（Nudnik）或“行动少数派”，驱动着市场约束。他们并非受合同细节驱动，而是出于道德义愤和正义感，通过公开谴责、投诉和诉讼来惩罚企业的不当行为。这些行动带来了广泛的益处，使“较真者”成为消费市场的“无名英雄”，尽管他们的个人动机或行为有时可能引发争议。

2.  ## 各章节摘要（每节120词以内）

    *   **驳斥传统消费者保护理论**
        阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔贝尔教授指出，长期存在的“知情少数派理论”——即少数知识渊博的消费者通过阅读合同来约束市场——是不切实际的，且在经验上受到挑战。他指出，消费者往往理性冷漠或无法理解复杂条款，从而导致消极被动。此外，通过在线评论实现声誉约束的理论也因其阐释不足而受到批评，这些理论未能解释可信信息是如何产生或传播的，并且常常依赖于有偏见或参与度低的数据。这些传统模型不足以解释现代市场中的消费者力量，从而促使人们寻求替代性解释。

    *   **引入“较真者”——一种新的消费者行动主义模式**
        阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔贝尔教授写道，一种新的“行动少数派”，被称为“较真者”（Nudniks），正作为消费者治理的关键力量出现。与假定的“知情少数派”不同，“较真者”的动机更多源于道德义愤，旨在惩罚企业的不当行为，而非告知他人。他们通常在事后（*ex post*）采取行动，通过投诉、评论和诉讼对令人失望的交易作出反应，并常常利用互联网。这种由“较真者”驱动的行动主义挑战了传统理论，表明即使消费者不阅读合同，消费者力量也可能有效，因为卖方有动机为所有消费者提高质量以避免公开纠纷。

    *   **“较真者”与其他消费者原型的对比**
        阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔贝尔教授写道，“较真者”——即那些极倾向于维护自身权利的消费者——与其他类型的消费者原型截然不同。“被动型消费者”（Passivists）是最大的群体，他们基本上不采取行动。“购物型消费者”（Shoppers）在事前（*ex ante*）仔细比较条款，并主要通过“退出”（转向竞争对手）来表达不满。“精明型消费者”（Sophisticates）则基于成本效益分析，策略性地利用合同条款获取个人利益。相比之下，“较真者”出于原则或道德义愤在事后（*ex post*）采取行动，通常在他人不会采取行动的情况下行动，其行为更有可能为所有消费者带来积极的溢出效应；而“精明型消费者”主要寻求可能不会惠及他人，甚至可能损害他人利益的私人收益。

    *   **“较真者”的动机、方法和影响**
        阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔贝尔教授写道，“较真者”受内在正义感或独特动机驱使，即使在行动成本对普通消费者而言似乎超过收益时，他们仍会采取行动。他们采用投诉、评论、诉讼以及病毒式社交媒体运动（例如“美联航摔坏吉他”事件）等策略来揭示卖方的失误。这种行动主义基于广泛的交易期望而非具体的合同条款，可能由单个个体发起，并通过社交媒体放大。卖方因法律和声誉风险而做出回应，通常会为所有消费者改善服务，这使得“较真者”在解决集体行动问题方面卓有成效。

    *   **回应针对“较真者”行动主义的批评与细微之处**
        阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔贝尔教授写道，尽管“较真者”的行动主义颇具影响力，但也并非没有隐忧。批评者质疑投诉是否总是具有代表性或有益，认为它们可能毫无意义或源于不切实际的期望。然而，他认为这些问题可能被夸大了。“较真者”是一个异质性群体，他们的行为即使是出于“怨恨”，也常常能突显真实的消费者利益，并可能促成市场范围内的改进。不具代表性的“较真者”的影响也会得到缓解，因为其他消费者倾向于只放大他们认为合理的抱怨，并且卖方也会积极管理预期。

    *   **结论：消费市场的无名英雄**
        阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔贝尔教授写道，尽管存在潜在弊端，“较真者”或“行动型消费者”通常具有净积极的社会影响，填补了因传统理论失效而留下的市场约束机制中的重要空白。他假设，关注这些坚持不懈的个体，可以揭示少数人如何通过法律和声誉激励，有效迫使卖方为所有消费者改善服务。因此，法律文献应将研究重点从“知情少数派”转向这些“较真者”。尽管他们常面临负面评价，却扮演着消费市场“无名英雄”的角色，尽管该领域仍需更多研究。

    *   **关于成本加成无固定费用（CPNF）合同的说明**
        阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔贝尔教授写道，在讨论问责机制时，成本加成无固定费用（CPNF）合同提供了一个有趣的参照。该模式挑战了传统合同理论，其代理人按成本工作，依赖信任和声誉机制而非明确的利润激励。他认为，CPNF可以作为一种“信息强制”机制。通过迫使代理人公开其成本和努力，CPNF有助于缓解委托-代理关系中常见的信息不对称问题，这与市场治理中信任和非标准激励的主题相呼应。`

We specifically emphasize the role of a small\nsubset of consumers that we dub “nudniks.” Nudniks are those\nconsumers who call in to complain, fill out satisfaction surveys, post\nonline reviews, and file lawsuits. Driven by an innate sense of justice\nand atypical motivations, these nudniks act as crusading consumers\nagainst underperforming sellers. Through their actions, nudniks direct\nattention to seller failure, leading to a variety of formal and informal\nsanctions, thus presenting a more realistic form of consumer activism in\ntoday’s overwhelming information environment.\nINTRODUCTION\nMarket discipline comes not only from legal protections, but also\nfrom consumers themselves. Understanding the effectiveness of con-\nsumer-driven market discipline mechanisms is key, as it dictates the\nscope and design of legal interventions.\nThe leading theory of market-based discipline has traditionally been\nthe informed minority theory.1 The theory concedes that most con-\nsumers lack sophistication or time to read their contracts and shop for\nbetter terms.2 Yet, it suggests that consumer-based governance of\nmarket discipline can be powerful.3 As long as a minority of consum-\ners are engaged with these aspects of the transaction, one could still\nexpect sellers to provide favorable terms. Sellers would compete over\nwho wins the segment of informed buyers, and in the process will have\nto modify their standard form contracts in ways that benefit the entire\nconsumer body, or so the theory goes. While enjoying large influence,\nover the years, the informed minority theory has encountered increas-\ning opposition. Perhaps most critically, recent empirical evidence sug-\ngests that the number of consumers that actually read and understand\ncontracts is too low to justify a change in sellers’ behavior.4 Even the\n1.

We use the term “consumer governance” in ways that bear similarities to the more oft-used\n“corporate governance” term: denoting the set of formal and informal rules that govern the\ninteractions between sellers and buyers.\n4.

In-\nstead of focusing on avid readers, focus on avid “enforcers”—those\nconsumers who demand to speak with the manager, fill out satisfac-\ntion surveys, post online reviews, and file lawsuits. We dub these con-\nsumers “nudniks.”6 Nudniks do not operate like most of us. They\npossess an innate sense of justice, atypical motivations, and an idio-\nsyncratic cost structure, which lead them to fight sellers who disap-\npoint—even in situations where most of us would not notice, or notice\nand stay passive. Nudniks are often perceived as petty and vindictive.\nYet, through their actions, nudniks provide an important public ser-\nvice: directing attention to failures in the market, thus leading to a\nvariety of formal and informal sanctions against misbehaving firms. In\nother words, nudniks generate underappreciated spillover effects that\nreverberate throughout the economy. This Essay explores the role of\nnudniks in the enforcement of market norms and consumer govern-\nance, evaluates their social contribution, and suggests this “crusading\nminority” of nudniks as a missing piece in theories of consumer mar-\nket governance.\nThis Essay argues that consumer activism predicated on a crusading\nminority of nudniks, who notice seller misbehavior and respond to it\nthrough legal-reputational channels, is a more realistic depiction of\nhow market discipline works than the informed minority theory.7\nNudniks complain and fight sellers publicly regardless of whether they\nread the contract in advance.

Some nudniks pursue nar-\nrow interests that do not benefit the rest of the consumer body and\nimpose unnecessary costs on sellers. While we do not venture to offer\na conclusive quantification of the net effect of nudniks, we do offer\nhere a synthesis of findings from the consumer complaining behavior\nliterature, suggesting that many nudniks positively contribute to the\nmarket. At the minimum, our analysis suggests that legal scholars and\npolicymakers should pay more attention to nudniks’ effects.\nThe nudniks are a response to the problems with the informed mi-\nnority theory. This theory essentially rests on two assumptions, re-\ngarding the what and the how of seller behavior. First, what sellers do:\nThe theory assumes that sellers compete over a small segment of con-\nsumers who read the contract and care about its terms. Second, how\nthey do it: To win the segment of readers, sellers have to offer better\nterms to all consumers across the board. Sellers operate through stan-\ndard-form contracts, and cannot tell which consumer is a reader and\nwhich is not before the fact; therefore, they are forced to offer better\nterms for all. In this Essay, we respond to the first premise. Many have\ntaken the recent empirical evidence of low readership rates to as un-\ndermining the possibility of internal market discipline. This Essay sug-\ngests that market discipline does not have to be predicated on\nconsumers reading the contract before purchasing; it can also come\nfrom consumers noticing and complaining publicly about sellers who\nfail to meet consumers’ transactional expectations, regardless of the\ncontract. In a separate paper, we confront the second assumption of\nthe informed minority theory: the premise that sellers cannot distin-\nguish between active and passive consumers.9 In today’s world, we ar-\ngue there, sellers can, and to a growing extent already do, employ big\n8.

Part I explores the leading theo-\nries of market-based, consumer governance mechanisms and their\nshortcomings. Part II suggests a new direction for thinking of market-\nbased consumer governance. Instead of counting how many consum-\ners read contracts, we need to shift attention to consumer dissatisfac-\ntion behavior: How many consumers complain after the purchase?\nHow do other potential consumers react to these complaints? What\nimpact do such complaints have on sellers? We emphasize the rise of\nthe internet and social media as factors that greatly empowered\nnudniks and increased their potential reach. As long as sellers are un-\nable to spot nudniks in advance,10 they are incentivized to provide\nhigher-quality service to all consumers ex ante, so as not to risk the\nreputation and legal risk that comes with nudniks. Part III evaluates\nthe shortcomings of nudnik-based activism. We conclude that while\nnot all nudnik-activity is socially beneficial, overall there is reason to\nbelieve that nudniks are the unsung heroes of market governance.\nI. CONSUMER GOVERNANCE VIA INFORMED MINORITY\nAND REPUTATIONAL SANCTIONS\nWhen parties enter into a contract, they assumedly select the terms\nthat advance their mutual goals.11 Yet in the context of consumer con-\ntracts, this standard assumption too often does not apply: For a variety\nof reasons, consumers are limited in their negotiation, enforcement,\nand monitoring of contract terms, thus creating an opportunity for\nsellers to offer inferior, one-sided terms. Do sellers take advantage of\nthis opportunity? If not, why? This Part provides a quick overview of\nthe extant literature on consumer governance. We start by noting the\nfactors that limit consumers’ ability to monitor sellers’ behavior di-\nrectly. We then detail the two most influential theories of how con-\nsumers can nevertheless discipline sellers—the informed minority\ntheory and the reputational discipline theory.\nA. The Limits of Consumer Governance\nWe use the term “consumer governance” here to denote the idea\nthat consumers can exert pressure on sellers who “misbehave,”\n10. For an exploration of how firms respond to the challenge posed by the nudnik based on\nbig-data and predictive algorithms, see id.\n11.

Thus defined, consumer governance runs into\nseveral well-known issues that ostensibly limit its effectiveness.\nFirst, consumers often lack the necessary sophistication to under-\nstand the terms of their contracts.12 The contractual language is com-\nplex, the grammar is convoluted, the vocabulary is full of legalese, and\neven the format tends to be quite jarring.13 The substance itself can\nalso be difficult to grasp, given the complex nature of some common\ntransactions (think, e.g., about the number of the parties involved in a\ntypical home purchase agreement). These difficulties present a chal-\nlenge to many consumers, especially in groups that suffer from low\nrates of financial and legal literacy.14\nSecond, many consumers are apathetic about the terms of their con-\ntracts.15 Apathy is said to be rational if the costs of being engaged\noutweigh the benefits. For many consumers, this is indeed the case:\nThe costs of reading contracts are immediate and certain, namely\none’s time and effort. The benefits of reading, by contrast, are remote\nand uncertain. Even if a consumer identifies an unfavorable choice-of-\nlaw clause, the odds of this clause mattering is quite low for any indi-\nvidual consumer.16 Moreover, the consumer will often lack the bar-\ngaining power necessary to negotiate any of the terms in contracts that\nare mostly based on standard forms. This makes reading the contract a\nlosing proposition from the consumer’s standpoint in many cases.17 In\n12. Michael I.

That is, even if it is worthwhile for them to read and\nnegotiate terms, they are bound by a variety of cognitive limitations\nand biases that would prevent them from reading. For example, con-\nsumers may act myopically, by failing to consider future possibilities\nor overly discount future events.18\nFinally, consumers often ignore and tend to remain passive when\nsellers disappoint. That is, consumers are not just passive pre-\npurchase, in reading and negotiating, but also passive post-purchase.\nPart of the reason for this passivity is that consumers are often una-\nware that their contractual rights were violated.19 Even when consum-\ners are sophisticated and sufficiently aware, they may opt to do\nnothing, simply because they consider taking action to be too costly.\nThis is especially true for bringing lawsuits and waging a legal battle.\nThe costs of bringing a lawsuit, the risk of losing the case, and the\ndifficulty of collecting judgments if you have won, all lead consumers\nto frequently abandon the pursuit of rights that they know were not\nmet.20 In fact, recent work suggests that reading the contract after the\nconsumer experienced a breach may actually make the consumer less\nlikely to complain, as sellers include unenforceable and otherwise mis-\nleading terms in their contracts, which cause buyers to give up.21\nOn paper, sellers would be aware of the confluence of these\nproblems and offer buyers inferior terms in their contracts ex ante,\nand fail to deliver on obligations ex post. Such seller behavior may\neasily lead to an eventual breakdown of consumer trust—akin to a\n“lemons problem,” whereby deep mistrust prevents many desirable\ntransactions.22 What stops this supposed race to the bottom? How do\nconsumer markets function given all these inherent problems? The le-\ngal literature has offered several theories in response. The next two\nSections elaborate.\n18.

The Informed Minority Theory and Its Limits\nThe most influential response to the abovementioned concerns has\nbeen Schwartz & Wilde’s informed minority theory.23 The informed\nminority theory readily concedes that the majority of consumers are\nunsophisticated and do not engage with the contracts before they\npurchase. Still, the theory argues that a minority of consumers are so-\nphisticated and do read their contracts carefully and negotiate the\nterms before purchasing. This informed minority diligently compares\nthe product and its terms to those offered by competitors. The efforts\nof the minority create demand-side pressure on firms to offer better\ncontractual terms, as doing so will allow firms to win this segment of\nthe market. Now, either because many consumer contracts are stan-\ndard-form agreements or because firms cannot distinguish between\nconsumers on the basis of their sophistication and tendency to read,24\nthe way a firm can win the hearts of the informed minority is by offer-\ning better terms across the board.25 Consequently, competitive pres-\nsures created by an informed minority push the entire market towards\na more consumer-friendly equilibrium where firms are competing not\nonly on price, but also on the quality of their contracts.\nThe informed minority theory thus explains why despite the lack of\nsophistication on the part of many consumers, contractual terms are\nnot the worst possible terms conceivable. The diligence of the in-\nformed minority is a bulwark against sellers’ tendency to grossly favor\nthemselves.\nWhile highly influential, the informed minority theory runs into the-\noretical and empirical problems.26 For the theory to work, there must\nbe a sufficiently sizable minority, a critical mass of readers (after all,\n23.

But consumers gener-\nally dislike reading contracts,27 and the private gains from reading can\nbe quite marginal—there is limited opportunity to negotiate terms,\ncompetitors might not offer significantly better terms, and there is a\ngood chance that the covered provision will never materialize.28 While\nthe costs are real and private, the benefits of reading are more remote\nand public—leading each individual consumer to attempt to free-ride\nthe efforts of others.29 Some recent empirical work now documents\nthe theoretical prediction: The number of people who actually read\ncontracts is too small to reach the critical mass needed for the in-\nformed minority mechanism to work.30\nEven if the informed minority theory was plausible when Schwartz\nand Wilde first developed it in the 1970s, the increase in length and\ncomplexity of consumer contracts occasioned by the rise of the digital\nage has gradually rendered the theory less and less fit for today’s\nworld.31 Contracts nowadays are also encumbered by the rise of ever-\nincreasing disclosures, which compete over, and overload, limited con-\nsumer attention.32 And while the non-law-and-economics scholars\nhave long been skeptical of the theory,33 nowadays even the law and\neconomics community loses faith.34 Exhibit A: Schwartz himself\nseems to believe that nobody reads contracts these days.35\nsumer Protection: The Problem of Inflated Transaction Costs, 47 WM. & MARY L.

Reputational Discipline Theory and Its Limits\nOther theories of bottom-up market discipline usually invoke the\nconcept of reputational sanctions.36 Legal scholars and economists\nhave suggested that reputational forces play an increasingly important\nrole in today’s consumer markets, given the rise of the internet and\nsocial media.37 The idea is that a seller who underperforms can expect\nbuyers to post negative online reviews, thereby causing other poten-\ntial buyers to avoid purchasing from the seller in the future. The pros-\npect of negative reputational information deters such seller\nmisbehavior ex ante, or so the argument goes.\nThe appeal of the reputational discipline theory is quite clear. And\nindeed, there exists evidence that both negative and positive reputa-\ntional information affect business revenues.38 However, theories that\ninvoke reputational discipline are usually underspecified and rely too\nmuch on strong assumptions. Sure, reputation matters. But how ex-\nactly is reputation produced? Who disseminates details of private in-\nteractions between a seller and a buyer? Is the information considered\ncredible? Do other buyers act on it? Existing accounts do not develop\nsatisfying answers to these questions. They implicitly assume that dis-\nsatisfied consumers put in motion meaningful reputational sanctions\nby transparently and mechanically sharing details of their dissatisfac-\ntion with others online. But given that accurate reputational informa-\ntion is a public good, why would an individual consumer find it\nworthwhile to share this information with others? And why would\nother consumers read, believe, and decide to act based on such infor-\nmation from another buyer (who, in all likelihood, they never met)?\nWriting reviews comes with certain costs—the time it takes to write\nthe review, the legal risk involved in defamation lawsuits,39 the social\n36.

Both of us have written extensively\non the important role that reputation plays in market discipline.43 Our\npoint here is that too often consumer governance theories that invoke\nreputation are under-specified. This gap calls for an explanation that\ncurrent theories fail to provide.\n*\nFor bottom-up market governance to emerge, consumers must\nwield sufficient power. Yet most consumers remain uninformed and\nunengaged. The public good nature of market discipline makes it sus-\nceptible to free riding and consumer collective action problems.\nWhere does effective consumer activism come from, then? One influ-\nential theory suggested that a critical mass of consumers who do read\ncontracts make sellers change their behavior toward all other consum-\ners. Yet the accumulated evidence suggests that in many markets such\na critical mass does not exist. Another influential theory suggests that\ndissatisfied consumers will complain online, thereby creating a reputa-\ntional risk for sellers. However, this reputational theory fails to ex-\nplain who invests in creating and diffusing credible information that\nleads other consumers to stop purchasing from a given seller, why\nthey do so, and how. Accordingly, there is a gap in our understanding\nof how consumer governance works. The next Part suggests a way to\nnarrow this gap by examining the role of a small subset of consumers\nwho notice and fight back whenever sellers underperform.\nII.

Part II.C ex-\nplains why consumer activism driven by nudniks is a more realistic\npossibility in today’s world than consumer activism driven by an in-\nformed minority. Finally, Part II.D elaborates on how nudniks bring\nchange in seller behavior.\nA. The Nudnik and Other Types of Consumers\nOriginally deriving from Yiddish, “nudnik” can be translated as “a\nbore, a nag, a jerk”44 or a “busybody.” While all these terms carry\nnegative connotations, we use the relatively unfamiliar nudnik term in\na neutral way.45 A nudnik, in our framework, denotes a consumer who\nis likely to vindicate her transactional rights. When she feels that her\nrights were breached, she will not “let it go” until she has addressed\nthe issue, even if most other consumers will not do so. The nudnik is\nthe type of consumer who will demand to speak with the manager,\nwrite an angry letter to the editor, or bring a lawsuit over a torn pair\nof pants that cost $40.\nTo understand the attributes and the role that nudniks play in con-\nsumer markets, it is useful to consider nudniks alongside various pro-\ntotypes of consumers. We can roughly separate the different types of\nconsumers into four categories: “Passivists,” “Shoppers,” “Sophisti-\ncates,” and “Nudniks.” A caveat is in order at the outset: Each of the\ncategories inevitably generalizes, and the lines are murky. Still, for our\nmodest purposes here—understanding what makes nudniks unique—\nthe rough categorization works. Figure 1 schematically illustrates this\nclassification.\n44.

In selecting products, passivists engage in a rudimentary price\nand term comparison. When problems with the product arise (e.g., a\nsmall overcharge, late shipping), they will not always notice, or note\nthe problem but do little about it. The most action a passivist would\ntake in response to service failure is refraining from purchasing the\nproduct again or complaining in a way that does not entail much ef-\nfort, such as asking the service representative about the issue.\nThe marketing literature has long documented that most consumers\nare passivists.46 Marketing scholar Professor Richard Oliver summa-\nrizes the typical consumer behavior by stating that “[c]onsumers do\nnot do anything, in the main, in response to consumption.”47 The 2006\nRetail Customer Dissatisfaction Study indeed found that only six per-\n46.

It involves social discord and\nmay require a considerable investment of time and effort.51 Activism\nmay be followed by social opprobrium. The time involved in com-\nplaining can also be quite substantial; we leave it as an exercise for the\nreader to estimate how long it would take to resolve a technical issue\nwith her cable company. The benefits of taking such action, by con-\ntrast, are uncertain: The seller may not yield to the consumer’s de-\nmands, and even if the seller relents, the value of such remedial action\nmay not be significant. On net, the value of an uncertain replacement\nof a faulty product can be easily outweighed by the certain investment\nof time and effort.52 In a study of 149 dissatisfied consumers who did\nnot complain, the consumers explained their inaction as follows:\nshortage of time was the leading reason (~21%), followed by lack of\nresponsiveness on part of sellers (~20%), and consumer personality\nfactors (some simply do not like the confrontation involved in com-\nplaining) (~17%).53\nNudniks, in contrast, are active.

While consumer passivism is often labelled “ra-\ntional,” we wish to avoid labeling consumer complaining as “irra-\ntional.” A nudnik who serially complains does not necessarily act\nirrationally.

But if one sees the nudnik’s preferences as consisting of\nbroader concerns, from spite to altruism to all other human motiva-\ntions that are in-between, then labeling his actions irrational no longer\nfits. For our purposes, it is immaterial what label one gives to their\nbehavior, so long as it is clear that nudniks defy the standard account\nof rational apathy.\nNudniks are not the only type of active consumers. “Shoppers” pre-\nsent another category:54 those consumers that the informed minority\ntheory envisions, who shop around, read contracts, and compare\namong products based on price, quality, and the terms of the con-\nsumer agreement. A shopper, for example, will not fly with a certain\nairline if she reads on the website that this airline is not willing to offer\ncompensation for delays; avoid a car dealership if the contract does\nnot provide warranties; or will not sign up for a credit card if the\nagreement shows cash advance fees that are too high. In other words,\nfor the shopper, the terms of the contract are the product. Nudniks, in\ncontrast, are not necessarily committed to studiously comparing\namong sellers. A nudnik can form her transactional expectations\nbased on the same sources that most other consumers use—negotia-\ntions with the seller, representations, advertisements, market norms,\nand so on.55\nShoppers exert pressure ex ante, before the purchase; nudniks exert\npressures ex post, after the purchase. If a seller includes an unfavora-\nble term in the fine print, such as denying refunds for defective prod-\nucts, this term may end up costing the seller consumers who are\nshoppers, as they will switch to a more consumer-friendly competitor.\nNudniks (like passivists) may not be as sensitive to the inclusion of\nsuch terms, if only because they may not read the fine print. On the\nother hand, a seller who actually enforces the term—e.g., denying the\nnudnik a refund for a broken printer—risks invoking the nudnik’s\nwrath. Herein lies another distinction. The shoppers’ mode of action is\nexit: they do not engage with sellers who offer inferior terms. By con-\ntrast, the nudnik’s mode of action is more elaborate, and consists of a\nvariety of voice strategies, both private and public.56\n54. Economic theories of search behavior focus on shoppers.

These broader transactional expectations may sometimes become part of the contract it-\nself—through tools of interpretation that focus on oral representations, trade customs, past deal-\nings, etc. See supra note 8.

These are the con-\nsumers who take advantage of the most favorable terms of the trans-\naction, strategize their use of the product to derive the most value,\nand file lawsuits when they expect a large judgment.57 The sophisti-\ncates are typified by higher levels of literacy, a better understanding of\nlegal concepts, and easier access to legal representation. The sophisti-\ncate is one to know which credit card to use in each transaction when\nchoosing among a dozen that are tightly packed in her wallet, when to\nmake a claim on her insurance policy, and how to maximize the value\nof her miles.58 Sophisticates are not just better at consuming, they are\nalso better at identifying profitable lawsuits. The sophisticate can tell\nwhen her contractual rights are violated, the value of filing a lawsuit\nor a complaint, and the most effective route to use.\nThe sophisticates are like nudniks, in a sense that they are “private\nenforcers” in the market. But, unlike nudniks, sophisticates enforce\nonly when a cold cost-benefit calculation says it pays to do so. In their\nenforcement actions, sophisticates are in a sense like bounty hunters.\nThey seek personal profit from vindicating their legal rights. A classic\nexample is the serial class action plaintiff who actively seeks wrongs so\nas to file profitable lawsuits. In China, consumer protection laws gave\nbirth to “counterfeit hunters”, who purchase counterfeits just so that\nthey can file a complaint to the regulator and collect a reward under\nthe rules there.59 Indeed, policy makers sometimes leverage bounty\nhunters to help with private enforcement of issues of public import—\nthink, for example, on the use of private rewards in qui tam claims.60\nSophisticates and nudniks are therefore birds of a different feather.\nSophisticates will complain or sue only when they are within their le-\ngal right to do so and when it pays to complain. Nudniks complain\nbecause it is in their blood. They do not like to be treated unfairly.\nThey believe that sellers should keep promises and will not stop until\nthe issue is rectified, regardless of a cold cost-benefit analysis of what\nit would take to keep fighting.

The nudniks, on the other hand, are more likely to take action\nvis-a`-vis the seller; when they feel the seller mistreated them, they will\ncomplain, bring a lawsuit, report to the regulator, and so on.\nAnother way to put it: Sophisticates operate based on the fine print,\nwhile nudniks do just fine without the print. The sophisticates act\nupon contractual rights they know they have; nudniks upon broad\ntransactional expectations.61 To illustrate, think about a restaurant\nthat notes in its terms and conditions a disclaimer that the chef holds\nfull discretion over how to cook the meat and will not replace a dish.\nIf the restaurant serves an overcooked steak, the irate nudnik will de-\nmand to have it replaced and it will comfort her little even if the res-\ntaurant’s general counsel reads her the contractual disclaimer.\nMeanwhile, the sophisticate will sit and angrily chew, recalling the ex-\nclusion in Article 7, subsection (3).\nAn important distinction for our purposes is that the nudnik’s ac-\ntions are more likely to generate positive spillovers than the sophisti-\ncate’s actions. When sophisticates use products optimally, they tend to\nextract private benefits. In fact, sophistication often leads to negative\nspillovers and cross-subsidies from less sophisticated consumers.62\nEven when sophisticates file lawsuits, or even class-actions, the private\nprofit motive suggests that they internalize a larger share of the value\nof their activities. An even more important distinction stems from the\nsophisticates’ dependence on the exogenous cost-benefit of private\nenforcement. To illustrate, consider the example of the class action\nplaintiff. Recent developments in American law, and specifically the\nwave of mandatory arbitration clauses, severely limit the scope of col-\nlective action, making it extremely difficult to benefit from bringing\nthem.63 In this environment, the bounty hunters who face an insur-\n61. The idea that consumers make choices based on background knowledge, not deriving di-\nrectly from the contract, was recently advanced by Ayres and Schwartz: “Consumers also learn\nabout the deals they make from visiting firms, their experience with similar deals, discussions\nwith friends, their observation of other consumers’ purchasing choices, and reading consumer\nreports.” Ayres & Schwartz, supra note 35, at 550–51.\n62.

Consider for example the case of “gripe sites.”64 When\nthe Partingtons ran into issues with their contractor, Stantons and\nSons Contracting, they opened a blog hosted under danstantonissue\n.com, where they detailed their negative experiences.65 Similarly, a\ndisappointed customer who bought an improperly installed fence from\nLowes opened the blog Lowes-Sucks.com.66 In both examples, the\ngripe sites share key features of nudnik-based activism: a small con-\nsumer resisting seller misbehavior and instead of doing nothing about\nit (as most consumers would), going to great lengths to fight the mis-\nbehavior seller publicly.67 Yet many other gripe sites exist,68 and some\nof them are used to blackmail companies and do not represent au-\nthentic consumer sentiments.69 The operator of the website may be\nsolely motivated by the desire to receive payment from the company\nto take down the website.

Still, the\npublicly-salient examples we use are helpful in a sense that they tease\nout certain recurring themes in nudnik-based activism.\nA classic example of a nudnik in action comes from Harvard Busi-\nness School Professor Ben Edelman. In 2014, Professor Edelman or-\ndered takeout from a local restaurant, Sichuan Garden.72 When he\nreviewed the check, he found that he was overcharged $1 for each of\nthe four items ordered.73 Edelman wrote a message on the restau-\nrant’s website and followed up with a detailed email, noting the $4\novercharge and asking for a clarification.74 The owner responded by\nnoting that the website prices have “been out of date” for quite some\ntime relative to the restaurant menu.75 Edelman then sought a com-\npensation of $12 for the overcharge, citing the Massachusetts Unfair\nand Deceptive Trade Practices Act, which permits treble damages in\ncertain cases.76 The owner refused, Edelman reported the incident to\nthe regulator and the parties continued corresponding until the story\nleaked to the media.

To clarify: the emphasis here is on “consistently.” The reader who wonders if she would be\nconsidered a nudnik in our framework because she once posted a review on Yelp or TripAdvisor\ncan ask herself this simple question: how often do I fight sellers when I am dissatisfied with the\nproduct or service. If I frequently take action when sellers disappoint, I am a nudnik (nothing\nwrong with it!).

Anecdotally, when we called the restaurant, five years\nafter the story broke and replicated the original order, we found the\npricing to be accurate: The online menu matched the actual prices\ndown to the penny. Edelman’s insistence here may strike some as “ir-\nrational,” as the opportunity cost of the time Edelman—a well-paid\nHarvard Business Professor and a sought-after consultant—spent on\nfighting the overcharge easily dwarfed the $12 he was ostensibly after.\nYet if it were not for people like Edelman who go through the trouble,\nrestaurants would have a much easier time systematically overcharg-\ning the rest of us.78\nAnother example came in 2011, when Molly Katchpole, a 22-year-\nold customer of Bank of America noticed an upcoming change in the\nbank’s fee structure.79 The bank was about to add a $5 charge to cer-\ntain debit-card users, a right the bank had under its contract with its\ncustomers.80 Molly not only noticed the upcoming change, she decided\nto fight back against it.81 She started an online petition, where she\nwrote: “[T]his change will hit low income customers the worst - in-\ncluding people like me, a recent college graduate working two part-\ntime jobs . . . .

When Katchpole’s\npetition gained traction, Bank of America quickly retracted its policy.\nAfter the Carroll video broke out, United Airlines promised to\nchange its customer service policy accordingly and asked permission\nto use the video in its internal training seminars (one trusts as an ex-\nemplar of what not to do).95 The ripple effects, interestingly, were felt\nmuch more broadly, and Carroll reports that several other companies\nlicensed his video as well for their internal training seminars.96\nThe nudnik’s activism is often part of repeat behavior.

Potentially attributable to their unique cost structure, public re-\nception of nudniks is not always favorable. The public mocks them\npartly because they are different. Yet it is precisely because they are\ndifferent that nudniks can solve the collective action problems that\nplague all other consumers. Nudniks take action when most of us do\nnot. And their action can lead to substantial changes in consumer\nmarkets—even when nudniks pursue the enforcement of rights not\nformally grounded in the contract.\nC. Why do Nudniks Prevail where the Informed Minority Fails?\nThe theory of the crusading minority sidesteps the issues that\nplague the informed minority theory along three key dimensions: (1)\nnudnik-based activism is not predicated on financial cost-benefit anal-\nysis, and so is less susceptible to changes in the market environment;\n(2) nudnik-based activism is not predicated on reading and compre-\nhending contracts; and, (3) nudnik-based activism is not predicated on\nthe existence of a critical mass of similarly minded activists.\nThe first factor concerns the cost of being an active consumer. Both\nshoppers and sophisticates are active because it pays for them to do\nso. They shop around, read contracts, and examine reviews because it\nallows them to find the best deals on the market, use the product opti-\nmally, or find profitable lawsuit opportunities. But this makes their\nactivism contingent and unreliable when the costs of becoming active\nrise. When the costs of becoming engaged increase, sophisticates and\nshoppers stop being involved. They will read, negotiate, and sue less.\nNudniks, by contrast, operate mostly based on motivations that are,\nin a sense, internal. They possess certain idiosyncratic personality\ntraits and beliefs that compel them to sink their teeth in and not let go\nwhen they feel wronged, regardless of the financial cost-benefit analy-\nsis. Elinor Ostrom argued that group norms are often enforced by a\nsubset of individuals within the group who are “willing punishers”:\nthose for whom fighting wrongs comes naturally (even at a personal\ncost—think about approaching an able-bodied person parking at a\ndisabled parking spot to scold him).105 While some may view this as-\npect of nudnik behavior as irrational or impetuous, for the nudnik it is\nthe right thing to do—you do not let people get away with violating\n105.

To be sure, there are limits to nudnik activism too.\nPresumably, when the costs of complaining, enlisting the help of the\nmedia, or filing a lawsuit are especially high, they will deter even the\nnudniks (or at least some of them) from voicing their concerns pub-\nlicly. Our point here is therefore not absolute but rather relative: An\nincrease in the costs of becoming involved is more likely to deter\nother types of consumers than it is to deter nudniks.\nThis difference in responding to the costs of activism makes nudniks\na better fit as active players in today’s consumer markets, relative to\nshoppers, sophisticates, and obviously passivists. In today’s markets,\ndisclosures and boilerplate terms are copied and reproduced at almost\nzero marginal cost, leading to an explosion of contractual data.106 The\nincrease in the length and complexity of contracts will most directly\nimpact shoppers, but less so the nudnik. The limitations on class ac-\ntions and the trend towards individual arbitration pose the greatest\nrisk for legally active sophisticates, but not necessarily nudniks.107\nEven companies’ increasing efforts to limit complaints have a limited\nimpact on nudniks, who tend to find a way.108\nThe same idiosyncratic motivations lead nudniks to produce reputa-\ntional information, as in posting detailed negative reviews online or\nsharing stories with other consumers, even when the costs of such ac-\ntivities dwarf any direct benefit. Note that most users of online plat-\nforms consult reviews but do not post them. The operation of these\nreputation markets is predicated on the few who do invest in posting\ninformative reviews, even when it does not pay to do so. In other\nwords, the fact that nudniks are driven by internal motivations and\nnot external cost-benefit analysis helps to solve not just the problems\nthat plague the informed minority theory, but also the problems that\nplague the reputational discipline theory.\nThe second key distinction is that nudniks can affect change even\nwithout thoroughly reading and comprehending contracts. Nudniks\nfrequently assert claims based on broader transactional expectations,\nthat is, what rights they believe they should have, regardless of what\nthe contract stipulates. As legal scholars have started to acknowledge,\nconsumers often form transactional expectations that are based not\n106.

Nudniks\nwill. When a cable company fails to arrive on time, the nudnik may\npost a negative review online, even if the fine print actually provides\nthe company the right to delay appointments with no prior notice.110\nIronically, the reading of the contract might lead sophisticates to be\nless active, as they will find the cable company’s actions permissible\nunder the contract.111\nReacting to transactional expectations, rather than the language of\nthe contract, makes nudnik-based activism more relevant in today’s\nconsumer markets relative to informed minority-based activity. While\nthe volume and complexity of contractual information has increased,\nmaking it less likely that consumers will read and comprehend their\ncontractual rights, consumers have been developing an increasingly\nricher set of transactional expectations. Consumers nowadays experi-\nence more market interactions and are exposed to more merchants\nand dealing styles (think online shopping comparisons). This develop-\nment broadens and sharpens their ability to compare products and\nsense what a viable market norm looks like. Indeed, one notable cus-\ntomer service report stated that “the digitally empowered customer\n[has led to] customer expectations soaring” and “54% of respondents\nsay they have higher expectations for customer service today than\nthey had one year ago.”112 This is to say that in today’s consumer mar-\nkets, consumers read contracts less but expect from the seller more.

For the informed minority\ntheory, size matters: If the subset of readers is not sufficiently large,\nsellers would not have sufficient incentives to adapt the firm’s offering\nto win over these comparison shoppers. Firms would simply ignore\nthis tiny segment of the market.\nNudniks work differently. They put reputational and legal sanctions\nin motion. For this reason, their power comes not necessarily from\nnumbers. One Ben Edelman was enough to stop the restaurant’s prac-\ntice of overcharging. A single Dave Caroll can create a public rela-\ntions crisis of large proportions. Just one lawsuit of an aggrieved Bank\nof America customer resulted in a multi-million-dollar award in puni-\ntive damages.113 To be sure, a single nudnik would not always be\nenough—indeed, sometimes even many nudniks’ complaints will not\nmove the seller. The point is that under certain conditions, a single\nnudnik’s fight can draw the attention of many others—a fact that is\nappreciated by crisis management firms.\nRecent changes in consumer markets have therefore made nudnik-\nbased activism relatively more impactful. The increase in contract\nlength and complexity and the rise of class action waivers have made\nnon-nudnik activists (and the informed minority theory) less relevant.\nAt the same time, the internet and in particular social media have\nincreased the ability of a single nudnik’s fight to bring a seller to its\nknees.114 Posting a negative review online increases the dissemination\npotential, the permanence, and the ease of accessibility of the damn-\ning information about the seller. Everyone searching for that seller in\nthe future can run into the nudnik’s detailed concern with the seller’s\nunderperformance. In other words, changes in the information envi-\nronment have boosted the nudnik’s signal and ability to shame firms\ninto meeting market norms.\n113. See, e.g., Sundquist v.

Why and How Sellers Accommodate Nudniks’ Concerns\nTo further underscore how nudniks bring about market-wide\nchanges in behavior, let us explore the question of how and why sell-\ners respond to nudniks. When nudniks have legally cognizable claims,\nthe mechanism is fairly straightforward. The pressure comes from\nnudniks’ complaints to the regulator, the filing of lawsuits, or the re-\nfusal to pay until the issue is settled. All of these actions impose direct\ncosts on firms, and the threat of these costs can deter seller misbehav-\nior ex ante.\nLess intuitively, sellers respond to nudniks even when the latter as-\nsert claims based on transactional expectations that are not grounded\nin the four corners of the contract.115 While firms are not legally obli-\ngated to appease the nudnik in such cases, they often have reputa-\ntional incentives to do so. A nudnik that posts a negative review\nonline, or talks with a reporter or a consumer organization may cause\nmore significant damage to the firm than any single lawsuit.116 Recall\nhow Molly Katchpole fought Bank of America for something that was\nwithin the bank’s contractual rights—changing its fee structure.117 An-\nother example is the 2017 incident whereby United Airlines evicted a\npaying passenger from the flight to accommodate another passen-\nger.118 Even though the airline company’s contract with the passenger\nstipulated that it can de-board him, treating a consumer that way\nseemed, in the eyes of United’s various stakeholders, as uncalled for,\nunfair, and bad business.119 The incident led to a swift and significant\n115.

Such potential reputational\neffects may be enough to drive firms to conform to consumers’ supra-\ncontractual expectations.121\nThe mere background threat of nudnik activity—the “shadow of the\nnudnik”—can be enough to affect change. A seller that deals with a\nlarge number of consumers and cannot identify in advance who will be\na nudnik,122 faces a choice. The seller could maintain its level of con-\ntractual performance and address nudniks once they reveal them-\nselves as such, hoping to be able to buy them off before they draw\nnegative attention to the firm’s behavior. Alternatively, the seller\ncould raise its level of contractual performance across the board, so\nthat not even nudniks would have something to complain about.\nAt least until recently, there were good reasons for firms to choose\nthe latter option and improve their contractual performance across all\nconsumers. The alternative—waiting until you realize you are dealing\nwith a nudnik—is simply too risky.123 If the firm only reaches a\nnudnik after she aired her grievances online, the negative review al-\nready has a life of its own and the firm’s potential future consumers\nmay read it and decide to go elsewhere.124 Similarly, if a firm only\napproaches a nudnik after she filed a lawsuit, then even if the firm\npaid her enough to get her to settle, the mere filing may leave enough\n120.

Sellers have\nstrong incentives to respond to nudniks for reasons that are both legal\nand reputational.

To be sure, nudniks are not omnipotent,\nand we cannot expect them to fix all (or even most) ills in consumer\nmarkets.

LIMITATIONS OF NUDNIK-BASED CONSUMER GOVERNANCE\nOur argument thus far has been straightforward: Instead of focusing\non a minority of consumers who read and negotiate terms before the\npurchase, legal scholars and policymakers should pay greater atten-\ntion to a minority of crusading consumers who take action when sell-\ners do not meet their transactional expectations. This Part introduces\nnuance. Nudnik-based behavior is not always socially beneficial. Some\nnudniks complain frivolously. Their transactional expectations may be\nunrealistic and untethered. Some complaints only reflect the nudniks’\nidiosyncratic preferences. Such behavior does not contribute to effec-\ntive seller deterrence, but rather imposes costs and hurts the function-\ning of consumer markets.

As the old adage goes,\n“[t]he squeaky wheel gets the grease.”128 Applied here, the concern is\nthat sellers will reward only the noisy consumers. More accurately, the\nconcern is twofold: (1) that sellers will reward noisy consumers at the\nexpense of other consumers and, importantly, (2) that the noisy con-\nsumers tend to be the “haves” rather than the “have-nots.”129 In other\nwords, to assess the social value of nudnik-based activism we have to\nask who gets what and at whose expense. But such distributional con-\ncerns about nudnik-based activism should not be overstated, for the\nfollowing three factors.\nFirst, to the extent these concerns are valid, they are not unique to\nnudnik-based activism but rather apply equally, or even more force-\nfully, to other forms of consumer activism. Consider the sophisticates,\nwho pursue legal actions for personal gain or find ways to optimally\nuse the products, or the shoppers who shop around for the best deals.\nConsumers in both of these categories are likely to be more privileged\nor sophisticated (by definition) than the rest of the consumer body\nand extract private benefits—sometimes at the expense of others.\nSecond and more specifically to nudniks, it is hardly evident that\nnudniks are overly privileged. While future empirical research is\nneeded on this issue, we can already point out studies in the consumer\ncomplaint behavior literature, showing that there actually exists great\nheterogeneity among serial complainers: nudniks cut across cultural,\neconomic, and social dimensions.130\nFinally, even if we assume that nudniks are the privileged ones,\ndoes it matter? If nudniks squeak loud enough, they can affect mar-\nket-wide changes that benefit the entire consumer body, including the\nrelatively less well off. The squeaky wheel can alert us all to the possi-\nbility that there is a problem with a given seller or a product. And\nproviding this service may sometimes actually require privilege. To il-\n128.

Some of the empirical research does suggest that, on average, serial complainers tend to\nbe more educated and affluent. But much more empirical research is needed before we can\nmake the leap to argue against nudniks in the name of distributional concerns. See, e.g., Michelle\nA. Morganosky & Hilda M. Buckley, Complaint Behavior: Analysis by Demographics, Lifestyle,\nand Consumer Values, 14 NA – ADVANCESIN CONSUMER RES. 223–26 (1987).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3568768\n\n<<PAGE_BREAK>>\n\n\\\\jciprod01\\productn\\D\\DPL\\69-2\\DPL206.txt unknown Seq: 31 21-APR-20 11:48\n2020] CONSUMER ACTIVISM 263\nlustrate, recall the Ben Edelman example of going on a crusade\nagainst an overcharge of $4. Perhaps it can be said that only someone\nwith sufficient financial security can spend so much time correspond-\ning over a $4 overcharge as a matter of principle.131\nAnother oft-mentioned concern with nudniks is their motivations.\nThe public, and sometimes even judges, tend to focus on nudniks’ sup-\nposed motivations and cast them negatively as vengeful and petty.\nGranted, some consumer crusaders are motivated by spite. But we do\nnot view spite as a strong argument against nudnik-behavior. In fact,\nspite may be a virtue in this context.\nSpite drives nudniks to be “willing punishers”—those who contrib-\nute to solve consumer collective action problems.132 While all consum-\ners may suffer from late deliveries or missed appointments by a seller,\neach consumer sees the costs of a public fight with the seller as dwarf-\ning whatever benefit she might get from a refund. Spite allows\nnudniks to transcend such cold cost-benefit calculation and motivate\npublic action that would provide a valuable service to all other con-\nsumers. In this sense, punishing a misbehaving seller out of spite could\nbe considered “other-regarding” by the nudnik.133 In fact, there is a\ncertain irony in treating spiteful nudniks negatively: Why not cast the\nmajority’s silence in the face of seller violations as a selfish, disinter-\nested attitude towards their fellow consumers? Consider for example\nhow most economic models of market discipline invoke the rhetoric of\n“consumer sharing” (with its positive connotations), to denote in-\nstances where one consumer learns about a product failure, and im-\nmediately shares the information with her fellow consumers. In\nreality, the overwhelming majority of consumers do not share. They\ndo nothing. If spite or pettiness or obsession makes nudniks de facto\nshare information with others, then so be it. The only concern should\nbe with whether the information nudniks generate is valuable to\nothers or not.\nThere is a broader point at play here. Legal scholars and policymak-\ners should focus less on what drives nudniks and more on the social\nimpact that nudniks generate. Focus more on the outputs and less on\nthe inputs. Even if nudniks are after revenge, material compensation,\nvalidation from others, or satisfying their own sense of entitlement,\n131. Unfortunately, it would seem that one has to have sufficient social capital to feel legiti-\nmized to complain and to have their complaints taken seriously.\n132. See Ostrom, supra note 105.\n133. SeeLYNN STOUT,CULTIVATING CONSCIENCE: HOW GOOD LAWS MAKE GOOD PEOPLE\n13–15 (2011) (describing “other-regarding behavior” as actions that express “concern for some-\none or something beyond one’s own material interests.”).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3568768\n\n<<PAGE_BREAK>>\n\n\\\\jciprod01\\productn\\D\\DPL\\69-2\\DPL206.txt unknown Seq: 32 21-APR-20 11:48\n264 DEPAUL LAW REVIEW [Vol.69:233\nthis should not matter too much, as long as nudniks generate positive\nspillovers for other consumers.\nThis brings us to the third and most important issue with nudniks’\nbehavior: representativeness. The biggest question when evaluating\nnudniks’ social impact is whether nudniks’ preferences and concerns\nare representative of the preferences and concerns of other, non-\nnudnik consumers. Some nudniks may complain about esoteric as-\npects of seller behavior that are inconsequential to other consumers.\nA particular issue is that some serial complainers may be “trolls,” that\nis, individuals who make spurious arguments for no other reason than\nto evoke a reaction from their target. They seek attention rather than\nimprovement. For such troll-based activism, the social contribution is\nlimited, and the negative treatment these troll-nudniks will receive in\nthe courtroom and the court of public opinion is justified.\nWe start our response to the “unrepresentative” argument by not-\ning that such a critique is not unique to nudnik-based activism. The\ncritique rather applies to other types of active consumers as well. A\nsophisticate filing a class action may be hunting a “bounty,” even if\nthe underlying cause is only technical and they were not really\nharmed. Indeed, we noted the example of counterfeit hunters in\nChina who go out of their way to find fake products to buy, so that\nthey can later complain that they bought a fake product.134 Whenever\none introduces a bounty (a profit-motive), one raises the risk of nega-\ntive-value behavior on part of the hunters. There is actually reason to\nbelieve that such negative-value behavior will be more common\namong non-nudniks; but more research is needed before reaching de-\nfinitive conclusions.\nAs for nudniks, the data there is limited, and future research is\nmuch needed. Yet the existing literature contains a few indications\nthat lead us to believe that the “unrepresentative” concern is grossly\noverstated. Elsewhere we synthesized findings from the consumer\ncomplaining behavior literature, indicating that serial complainers\noften operate in good faith and implicate broader consumer inter-\nest.135 For example, we pointed out studies establishing a link between\nseller behavior and consumer complaining—better service leads to\nfewer complaints. Sellers who want to avoid the wrath of nudniks are\nable to do so by offering a better product. Another finding is that\nserial complainers are more likely to be loyal to a seller who rectifies\n134.

Again, this stylized fact of consumer complaining behavior\nsuggests a positive dynamic: It is not that serial complainers are only\nafter making a seller’s life miserable. If consumers perceive the seller\nas making a genuine effort to satisfy their expectations, they will pay\nthe seller back by continuously purchasing from her. To reiterate, we\nacknowledge that we cannot offer here conclusive proof on the repre-\nsentativeness of nudniks’ expectations, or the ratio of valid-to-frivo-\nlous complaints. Still, these findings are at least suggestive that\nnudniks’ interests are correlated with those of other consumers.\nAnother reason to not overstate the concern with idiosyncratic ex-\npectations is that sellers do not remain passive. Sellers can, and often\ndo, employ various tools to defend themselves from “bad” nudniks\nwith unwarranted complaints. For example, sellers can avoid unrealis-\ntic buyers’ expectations through salient and repeated communication.\nTo illustrate, consider how stores that do not accept certain modes of\npayment frequently communicate this fact clearly to the consumer in\nadvance, with large and visible signs, despite the absence of any legal\nduty to do so. Consider also the large signs one often encounters with\nlimitations, disclaimers, and special conditions on how meals are non-\nreturnable, sales are final, or seats on a flight are tentative. In other\nwords, sellers can reduce the risk of unrealistic consumer expectations\nby modifying consumer expectations in advance. This is a feature of\nnudnik-based consumer governance, rather than a bug in the system.\nIf there are hidden aspects of the transaction that consumers care\nabout, advertising them in a salient manner helps both parties deter-\nmine in advance if the transaction is mutually advantageous. The\nbackground threat of nudniks attacking sellers for violating their ex-\npectations incentivizes sellers to mitigate with the gap between trans-\nactional expectations and the actual transaction.\nYet another reason to not overstate the costs of bad nudnik behav-\nior is the involvement of other, non-nudnik consumers. Nudniks’ com-\nplaints create a reputational sanction only to the extent that other\nconsumers learn about, share, and act upon the information they re-\nceived from nudniks. These other consumers are not clueless; they can\ndecide for themselves whether the nudnik’s complaint raises a valid\nissue or not. Dave Carroll’s “United Breaks Guitars” hurt United not\njust because of Dave’s singing talent, but probably also because it res-\nonated with other United consumers, hitting on a widely-shared frus-\ntration with how airline companies treat luggage. If Dave would have\nwritten a song about how Amazon does not deliver on time, we sus-\npect that his complaint would not have gone viral, because most con-\nsumers have a positive experience with Amazon shipments.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3568768\n\n<<PAGE_BREAK>>\n\n\\\\jciprod01\\productn\\D\\DPL\\69-2\\DPL206.txt unknown Seq: 34 21-APR-20 11:48\n266 DEPAUL LAW REVIEW [Vol.69:233\nTo illustrate with another infamous example, consider the case of\nTaylor Chapman. When Chapman did not receive a receipt at her last\nvisit to Dunkin’ Donuts, she sought to avail herself of the “free-donut-\nif-we-don’t-give-you-a-receipt” policy.136 She recorded an exchange\nwhere she demanded—using expletives and blatantly racist and sexist\nremarks—that the store manager will provide her with a free meal.137\nChapman posted the exchange on social media, and it received exten-\nsive exposure (over a million views), yet the result was not a reputa-\ntional fallout for Dunkin’ Donuts, but rather a hit to Chapman’s own\nreputation.138 Unlike with the United Airlines example, Dunkin’\nDonuts did not experience a drop in stock price or in consumers’ will-\ningness to purchase.\nTo reiterate, we readily acknowledge that some nudnik complaints\nare frivolous. But there is reason to believe that nudniks’ net social\nimpact is positive and that they fill in an important gap in the market-\nplace. It is therefore imperative to not dismiss the contribution of\nnudniks because they may strike some as spiteful, selfish, or idiosyn-\ncratic. Instead, we should strive to continue studying the conditions\nunder which nudniks are more or less valuable to market discipline.\nCONCLUSION\nWhere does consumer governance come from? How do consumer\nmarkets maintain norms of behavior? Legal institutions are not the\nonly ones deterring seller misbehavior; market mechanisms deter, too.\nUnderstanding the effectiveness of market forces is key for legal\nscholars and policymakers, as these forces set the outer limits on the\nneed for legal intervention. Yet, the legal literature has overly focused\non one type of market mechanism, namely, an informed minority,\nwhich is seemingly less relevant in today’s world. This Essay suggests\nswitching focus to a different mechanism, namely, a minority of cru-\nsading consumers—a small subset of consumers who go to great\nlengths to complain publicly about seller misbehavior, and in the pro-\ncess draw others’ attention and put in motion reputational sanctions.\nDirecting attention to the nudnik phenomenon is a first step toward\nunderstanding consumer governance in today’s world.
