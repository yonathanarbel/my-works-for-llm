1.  ## TL;DR ≤100 words
    Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that while Professor Croley's *Civil Justice Reconsidered* aptly describes the civil justice crisis of cost and inaccessibility, its diagnosis of under-participation by meritorious plaintiffs is not empirically proven and its reliance on win rates is misleading. Arbel contends Croley's proposed reforms, like increasing case volume, would overwhelm the system, especially concerning the neglected crisis in debt collection. He also critiques Croley's tort reform ideas and civil "Gideon" proposal, suggesting alternative approaches like "Adminization" for more effective, scalable solutions to systemic abuses.

    **Section 1: Introduction to Croley's "Civil Justice Reconsidered"**
    Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Professor Croley's book, *Civil Justice Reconsidered*, compellingly argues the civil justice system is in crisis due to excessive costs, slowness, and inaccessibility, undermining its core functions. This collection of essays by leading scholars examines facets like the "vanishing trial" and pro se litigation challenges, proposing complex solutions. Arbel notes Croley's accessible book, likened to a robust camel adapted to its environment, leverages his synoptic view and practical expertise to offer a clear, comprehensive exposition for policymakers and citizens, despite civil litigation not appearing intelligently designed.

    **Section 2: Croley's Core Arguments and Arbel's Initial Caveats**
    Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Croley first dispels the perception of a U.S. civil litigation system corrupted by rapacious plaintiffs, finding little empirical evidence of pro-plaintiff bias and deeming abuse claims overstated. Croley's second proposition is that the system's true problem is under-participation by meritorious plaintiffs deterred by costs and complexity, proposing streamlined procedures for 'more cases, less litigation'. While Arbel sees Croley's book as a trusted guide for practical reforms, he notes a caveat: its dual goals—arguing over-litigation isn't severe while under-litigation is—are not always consonant, with the under-participation point lacking direct empirical proof.

    **Section 3: Critiquing Croley on Under-Participation, Win Rates, and Debt Collection**
    Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while Croley argues expensive litigation suggests under-participation, he fails to rigorously prove a shortfall of socially important cases. Croley's use of plaintiff win rates to imply a neutral system is problematic, as reforms to include more meritorious plaintiffs would then suggest bias by that same metric. Arbel notes win rates can be misleading, citing the Israeli criminal justice system. He criticizes the insufficient attention paid to debt collection lawsuits, the most voluminous civil cases, where alarming evidence shows a "broken system" of default judgments on scant evidence, which Croley's marginalist approach would likely overwhelm.

    **Section 4: Arbel's Alternative Proposals and Further Critiques of Croley**
    Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes about his "Adminization" proposal, where a governmental agency audits court cases and levies fines, creating cost-effective, scalable consumer protection. He observes that tort reform has shapeshifted, with strategies like apology laws acting as covert reform. While Croley's tort reform proposals are sensible, Arbel argues they don't address new frontiers like tortfeasors using strategic apologies. Finally, he suggests Croley's recommendation for a civil "Gideon" right, mandating subsidized lawyering for indigent plaintiffs, may prove counter-productive.
