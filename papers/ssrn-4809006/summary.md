## TL;DR ≤100 words
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues for critically examining and updating legal doctrines by incorporating factors like time in contract interpretation, the profound societal and legal impacts of AI (including "AI Lies" in ssrn-4809006), and economic or behavioral insights into legal practice and individual rights. He challenges static views and advocates for dynamic, context-aware approaches to emerging legal challenges and established principles, from unbundling legal services to understanding copyright in the age of generative AI and the subtleties of price obfuscation and information disclosure.

## Section Summaries ≤120 words each

1.  **The Great Unbundling:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the legal profession is undergoing the "Great Unbundling," where traditional legal services are disaggregated into smaller, specialized components. He states this shift, driven by technology, client demands, and regulatory changes, offers opportunities for increased access and efficiency but also poses significant challenges regarding quality control, ethics, and the profession's identity.
2.  **Contract Creep:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that boilerplate contractual terms like arbitration clauses and class action waivers are insidiously spreading into diverse legal fields beyond consumer contracts, a phenomenon he terms "contract creep." He argues this expansion of contractual ideologies into non-contractual areas, often without meaningful assent, erodes established public norms and individual rights.
3.  **Time and Contract Interpretation (Historical Evolution):** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contrary to viewing contract interpretation as timeless, it is deeply intertwined with and shaped by the passage of time. He demonstrates how interpretive methodologies are not static but evolve through distinct historical eras, reflecting shifts in legal theory, economic conditions, and societal values.
4.  **Contract Interpretation Theories (Textualism, Contextualism):** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contract interpretation, a muddled affair, primarily seeks to divine parties’ intent through textualism (plain meaning of written words) and contextualism (welcoming extrinsic evidence due to word ambiguity). He also introduces a "half" theory of modified textualism, allowing limited contextual analysis for ambiguities or trade terms.
5.  **Static Interpretation Fallacy:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that current contract interpretation theories suffer from a "Static Interpretation Fallacy" by largely ignoring time and how term meanings and context evolve after contract formation. He proposes a "Dynamic Interpretive Framework" that explicitly incorporates the temporal dimension for more accurate and equitable adjudications.
6.  **The Cost of Thinking:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that this paper challenges the perception of thinking as a 'free good,' arguing cognitive effort carries significant hidden expenses. He posits these unacknowledged costs (e.g., reduced productivity, decision fatigue, health detriments) lead to misallocated mental resources and suboptimal outcomes if not properly understood.
7.  **Contract Interpretation: Meaning vs. Intent Prediction:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that traditional contract interpretation focuses on the objective meaning of words at contract formation, often downplaying subjective intentions. He notes an alternative perspective views interpretation as predicting parties' unstated intentions, reconstructing the hypothetical bargain for unconsidered contingencies.
8.  **Textualism's Limits and Context:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while textualists might envision a "lawyer's Paradise" with fixed word meanings, this overlooks language's inherent defectiveness. In contrast, he states interpretation always occurs within a context, with pre-existing interpretive assumptions shaping understanding even for seemingly unambiguous sentences.
9.  **Inherent Uncertainty in Contractual Language:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contractual language is inherently uncertain, as words lack self-evident meanings and rarely convey identical understanding to all parties. Consequently, he argues courts must invariably consider extrinsic evidence of surrounding circumstances to ascertain intended meaning before determining legal rights.
10. **Precision vs. Accuracy in Legal AI:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that precision in legal AI refers to the consistency and repeatability of its outputs, distinct from its correctness. Accuracy, conversely, measures how closely AI outputs correspond to true legal outcomes, highlighting that an AI can be precise without being accurate.
11. **Static Nature of Current Interpretation Doctrines:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that current contract interpretation doctrines, like the plain meaning rule and parol evidence rule, are fundamentally static tools struggling with how contractual terms' meaning and context change over time. He proposes a dynamic approach, introducing "temporal dynamics" to better address evolving contracts and interpretations.
12. **Contracting with Language Models:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his article is the first to systematically explore implications of contracting with language models (LMs) integrated into the contracting lifecycle. While LMs offer efficiency, he notes they introduce novel challenges (interpretability, reliability, accountability), proposing enhanced human oversight and adapted legal frameworks.
13. **Textualism, Contextualism, and Time:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the textualism versus contextualism debate in contract interpretation overlooks time's crucial dimension. He argues textualism's precision is initially superior in deterring litigation, but as unforeseen contingencies arise, contextualism's flexibility becomes more valuable for achieving accuracy over a contract's life.
14. **Contract Law in the Age of AI:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that AI's integration into contractual processes fundamentally challenges contract law due to AI's "black box" nature, potential "hallucinations," and manipulation susceptibility, undermining doctrines reliant on human intentionality. His paper explores these impacts on contract stages and broader issues of autonomy, efficiency, and fairness.
15. **Bias-Variance Tradeoff in Contract Interpretation:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the statistical bias-variance tradeoff offers a framework for analyzing the tension between formalist and contextualist contract interpretation. Bias is an interpretive rule's systematic deviation from true intent; variance captures outcome unpredictability, with an inherent tradeoff between them.
16. **AI Judges and the Future of Justice:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that integrating AI judges, while challenging, holds promise for revolutionizing justice administration through potential unparalleled efficiency and consistency. He emphasizes that realizing this requires carefully navigating formidable ethical, due process, and societal hurdles of AI judicial decision-making.
17. **Quantitative Analysis in "Time and Contract Interpretation":** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes about "Time and Contract Interpretation," noting a specific page includes mathematical formulas for Bias squared (Bias²) and Variance. He also mentions the year 1992, indicating a quantitative or historical data aspect to his analysis.
18. **Generative AI as Contract Interpreter:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contract interpretation is intractable due to language's vagueness, ambiguity, and incompleteness, leading to costly, error-prone human processes. He suggests Large Language Models (LLMs) offer "Computational Contract Interpretation," potentially analyzing contracts with greater speed and consistency.
19. **Temporal Contract Interpretation Framework:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contracts are inherently temporal, yet dominant interpretation theories largely overlook this, treating them as static. His article challenges this by proposing a new framework for temporal contract interpretation, distinguishing *ex ante* (formation meaning) and *ex post* (evolved meaning) interpretation.
20. **LLMs: Interpretation versus Simulation in Contracts:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Large Language Models' key innovation in contract interpretation is simulating how contractual language would likely operate in practice—what the contract *does* by modeling party behavior. This contrasts with traditional interpretation seeking to understand what the contract *means*.
21. **Challenging 'Point-in-Time' Contract Interpretation:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contract law has long assumed meaning is fixed at formation (the 'point-in-time' approach). His Article challenges this, arguing meaning evolves and interpretation should adapt, proposing a 'dynamic interpretation' framework.
22. **The Paradox of Disclosure:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes about the "paradox of disclosure," positing that individuals disclosing *more* information can, counterintuitively, enhance their privacy. He explains this occurs because widespread disclosure can make specific information common, less distinctive, and thus less valuable for targeting by reducing its signal.
23. **Consent and Knowledge in Intimate Arrangements:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that if one party is confident another prefers a new arrangement, informing them without explicit consent isn't a breach when there's no uncertainty about interests. He notes intimates, with deeper mutual knowledge, can reliably act on evolving understandings, adopting an ex-post view of their arrangements.
24. **Generative AI and Copyright Infringement:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that generative AI models trained on vast copyrighted materials create a conflict between AI developers claiming fair use and creators alleging infringement. He argues current copyright law is ill-suited, and training AI on copyrighted works fundamentally constitutes infringement, with fair use an unlikely defense.
25. **Contracts as "Time-Traveling Devices":** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contract interpretation's difficulty, with textualist/contextualist struggles, stems from failing to appreciate *time's* crucial role. He proposes that understanding contracts as "time-traveling devices" for an uncertain future can reframe the debate and offer novel solutions.
26. **"AI Lies" and Societal Risk (SSRN 4809006):** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that current AI systems frequently generate false, misleading, or fictitious outputs, termed "AI Lies" to emphasize their harmful impact over mere "hallucinations." He warns that as AI integrates into critical life aspects, these "AI Lies" pose a significant, widespread societal risk.
27. **The "Problem of Time" in Contract Interpretation:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contract interpretation faces a "problem of time": whether to use word meanings from drafting (T1) or litigation (T2). While prevailing originalism (T1) is favored, he challenges this, arguing it can be suboptimal and proposes a new framework considering contractual language's temporality.
28. **Price Obfuscation in Online Markets (Linked to SSRN 4809006 by user):** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that price obfuscation in online markets systematically disadvantages consumers, leading to overpayment and reduced market efficiency by hindering comparisons. He suggests existing legal frameworks are ill-equipped, needing interventions like enhanced disclosure and stricter enforcement.
29. **Temporal Interpretation of Contracts (Linked to SSRN 4809006 by user):** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that traditional static contract interpretation, focused on original intent, is incomplete. He argues time actively shapes contractual meaning, advocating for a "temporal interpretation" framework considering evolving language, performance history, and changing contexts for an adaptive, equitable approach.
30. **Scholarly Foundations (References in SSRN 4809006):** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his research (implicitly for ssrn-4809006) is built upon referencing a diverse range of scholarly works. These include studies on language, pragmatics, plain meaning, contractual silence, the UCC, foundational linguistics (Saussure), contract interpretation analyses (Posner, Mitchell), and modern machine learning studies.
31. **Temporal Decay and Plain Meaning (Linked to SSRN 4809006 by user):** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that time's passage systematically erodes contract interpretation accuracy, increasing judicial error risk due to factors like fading memories and shifting linguistic contexts. To counteract this, he suggests courts should increasingly favor a contract's plain meaning as it ages, anchoring interpretation in more stable evidence.
