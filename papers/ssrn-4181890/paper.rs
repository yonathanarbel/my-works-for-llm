1. Introduction
Whenstatementsaremadeinpublic,audiencesassesstheircredibilitybased
onavarietyofcues.Oneofthesecuesishowstrictlythelawsanctionsfalse
statements, i.e., whether talk is cheap. Such audience effects complicate the
standardanalysisofdefamationlaw,whichtraditionallyonlyfocusesonhow
the law affects speakers and the subjects of their speech. We investigate here
theoptimalstrictnessofdefamationlawwhenaccountingforaudienceeffects.
Defamation law imposes tort liability on speakers who publish false state-
ments that harm their target’s good name. A typical example comes from a
recentcasewhereahospitalstafferfalselyallegedthatadoctorwasworking
undertheinfluenceofalcohol.Thedoctorwonalawsuitagainstthestafferand
recoveredmillionsofdollarsindamages(Denmanv.St.Vincent,2020).While
the basic structure of defamation law is well established, there is an ongoing
socialdebateondefamationlaw’sproperscope.WithcallsfromtheSupreme
Court, legal scholars, politicians, and various pundits, there is growing pres-
suretodaytoreformdefamationlaw(Arbel&Mungan,2019).Inthemidstof
thesecalls,anewRestatementprojectwasrecentlyannounced.
Theliteratureondefamationlawisvast,buttheeconomicanalysisofdefama-
tion law is quite limited (Hemel, 2020). In deciding the level of strictness of
defamationlaw,standardlegalanalysesaredominatedbyatwo-sidedbalanc-
ing act. On the one hand, society considers the interests of the target of the
speech—her need for compensation and the need to protect her by deterring
defamatory speech against her. On the other hand, society also considers the
speaker,hisrighttofreespeech,andthesocialconcernwithchillingvaluable
speech(NYTimesv.Sullivan,1964).

counts(Hemel&Porat,2019&Arbel&Mungan,2019)suggestthatomission
ofaudienceeffectsisconsequentialtotheoptimalstrictnessofdefamationlaw.
Our object here is to bridge this gap by offering a general framework that
analyzesbehaviorandevaluateswelfarebasedonthestrictnessofdefamation
law. To do so, we construct a model that includes three key features: (i) a
Bayesian (rather than a na¨ıve) audience, (ii) errors in the court’s judgment
(wrongfulliabilityaswellaswrongfulfailuretofindliability),and(iii)acap
onrecoverabledamages.Weexplaintheroleeachofthesefeaturesplays,after
brieflyreviewingthestructureofourmodelanditsimplications.
Weconsiderthebehaviorofthreeparties.Aspeaker,whohasprivateinfor-
mation about a certain target – a business or an individual. The speaker may
make claims about the target to an audience member. The audience member
then decides whether to interact—trade, collaborate, socialize—with the tar-
get. Targets can be a high- or low-type, and audiences would rather interact
only with the former kind. If the target loses an interaction, he may bring a
lawsuitagainstthespeakerallegingdefamation.Westudybehaviorunderdif-
ferentlevelsofdamagesfordefamationandtheirsocialwelfareimplications.
Our analysis reveals three central findings. First, we find that there is an
optimallevelofdamagesthatsupportsseparatingequilibriainwhichwould-be
defamersaredeterredfromsharingfalseinformationandspeakersonlyshare
informationhonestlywiththeiraudience.Audiencemembersbelievespeakers
and act upon this information. Naturally, social welfare is highest under this
regime.
Second, we find that defamation laws often follow a ‘Laffer Curve.’ Lax
regulationresultsinafloodofcheaptalk,whichleadstoaudiencesdiscount-
ing all statements—true or false—and simply acting on their priors. This re-
sultsinequilibriawhereimportantinformationisleftuncommunicated.Sanc-
tioningdefamationtoostrictlyisalsounwanted,becausehighsanctionsinvite
frivolous litigation, which in turn chills true negative statements. In between

with a range of optimal damages. Thus, our unified framework shows that

Our third result emerges when the cap on damages is lower than the level
necessary to support equilibria in which the target’s type is fully revealed. In
reality, it is difficult to calculate the exact level of damages, and even when
possible,damagesareboundedbybothconstitutionalconsiderationsandlim-
its on defendants’ wealth. In such cases, we find that a lax approach can be
superiortoamorestringentone.Thereasonisthatstringentregulationinvites
audience trust, but because some statements are false, this trust can be mis-
placed, leading to the deterrence of valuable interactions. Compounding the
issueisthatstringentregulationincreaseslitigation.Laxregulation,however,
invitesaudiencestorelymoreontheirpriorsandreduceslitigation.Thus,per-
hapscounter-intuitively,laxregulationbecomespreferabletostrictregulation
whenreputationalharmsarelarge,andtheoppositeconclusionmayholdwhen
reputationalharmsaresmall.
All three features of our model (Bayesian audience, judgment errors, and
damagecaps)playimportantrolesintheproductionoftheseresults.
First, when courts make no errors in judgment, people have no incentive
tobringfrivolousclaimsagainstspeakers.Inthiscaseverylargedamages(if
feasible) are always preferable to smaller damages, because they only deter
falsespeechwithouthavinganyimpactontruenegativespeech.Thisisady-
namicthatemergesinmanyothercontextsaswell,andhighlightstheroleof
judgment errors in explaining the inefficiency of very large damages in the
defamation context, and the emergence of the Laffer Curve to which we al-
luded.
Second, the prior economics literature on defamation law assumes that a
publisher(e.g.atabloid, journal,anindividualetc.)canalwaysharmanother
personbymakingnegativestatementsaboutthem,andtheextentofthisharm
isindependentofthelawsinplace(e.g., Garoupa1999a,b, Bar-Gill&Ham-
dani 2003).1 This is equivalent to the audience –whose beliefs and behavior
isnotconsideredinthepriorliterature–naivelyformingitsbeliefsandacting
uponthem.Thus,inthepriorliterature,themainfunctionofreformingthelaw
is to alter the expected costs and benefits of making disparaging statements,
but not the harmful impact of defamatory statements. With a na¨ıve audience,
increasingdamagesleadstoareductionintheexpectedharmtothetarget,be-
causeitdetersnegativespeech.ThisisnotsowhentheaudienceisBayesian.
Becauseverylowdamagesresultinfrequentfalseallegations,theydilutethe
informational content of speech, and therefore causes the audience to act ac-
cordingtoitspriors.Thus,inadditiontoprovidingstraightforwardrationales
for some behavioral responses in the defamation context (e.g., disregarding
certainfalsespeech),theincorporationofBayesianaudiencesalsohasimpor-
tantnormativeimplications, e.g., loweringdamagescanreducetheharmthat
resultsfromdefamatorystatements.

Third, this normative distinction becomes quite significant with binding
damagecaps,2 inwhichcasefalsedisparagingremarkscannotbefullyelimi-
nated.Thus,withBayesianaudiences,thechoiceisbetweenahighdegreeof
interactionsbetweentheaudienceandtargets(goodandbad)achievedthrough
lowdamages,andthemaximumlevelofdamagesthatcausesbadinteractions
tobedeterredalongwithsomegoodinteractions.Theformeroptionisprefer-
ablewhenthevalueofgoodinteractionsarelarge.Ontheotherhand, witha
na¨ıveaudience,maximumdamagesarealwayspreferable,becauseevenwith
low damages the audience believes false disparaging remarks, which are in
highsupplyduetothelackofdeterrentdamages.
In short, the main impact of judicial errors in our analysis is to rule out
theoptimalityofverylargedamages.Thisbecomesanimportantissuewhen
the damage cap is very large (or non-existent), in which case the presence
of judicial errors supplies an independent rationale for not having very large
damages.Ontheotherhand,whenthedamagecapisbinding,ana¨ıveaudience
impliesthatthemaximumdamageisoptimal,andthisresultisoverturnedwith
Bayesianaudiences.
While our analysis focuses on defamation law, the basic question we pose
here is relevant for a broad range of legal contexts. The law regulates false
speechindomainsasdiverseascorporatedisclosures,falseadvertising,whistle-
blowers, and law enforcement. Common to these domains is a basic tension
betweenthestrictnessofsanctionsformisreportingandtheinformativenessof

Defamation law evolved in the common and ecclesiastical courts of Eng-
land. In the United States, the states took the doctrine and used it to develop
theirownvariants.Amajordevelopmenttookplacein1964,whentheSupreme
Court decided the seminal case of NYTimes v. Sullivan. There, the Court re-
viewedtheexistingbodyofdoctrineinlightoftheFirstAmendmentprotec-
tionoffreespeechandpress.TheCourtmadeitconsiderablyharderforpublic
figures to bring lawsuits on matters of public interest. In the years that fol-
lowed,thedoctrinewasrefinedand,whilestillcarryingsignsofitsconvoluted
history,reachedacertaindegreeofbalance.Inrecentyears,however,therehas
beengrowingpressuretoreformthelaw.CommentsfromtheSupremeCourt
(McKee v. Cosby, 2019; Berrisha v. Lawson, 2021), the political sphere, le-
galcommentators, andpundits—allrevealdissatisfactionwiththelaw.Many
ofthesecommentssuggestthatdefamationlawshouldbemadestricter; e.g.,
CassSunsteincalledtheNYTimesv.Sullivandecision‘anachronistic’andar-
guedthatpublicfiguresshouldbeallowedtobringsuitmoreeasily(Sunstein,
2021). Interestingly, the reason why the law should protect good name inter-
estsisnotwellunderstood.Somegroundthelaw’sinterventioninaproperty
likeinterestingoodname,orgoodname’sbasisindignity,property,andhonor
(Post, 1984) while others relate it to concepts of social status and reputation
(Arbel,2021).
The legal literature on defamation law is rich and vast, and it explores a
varietyoftopics,involvingdeepquestionsofpoliticalphilosophyandconsti-
tutionalcommitments.Itisthereforequitesurprisingthattheliteratureonthe
economicsofdefamationlaw‘haslagged’andissparse(Hemel,2020).Some
notablecontributionsinthisspaceincludesRichardPosner’spioneeringanal-
ysis (Posner, 1973, 1986), which highlighted the applicability of cost-benefit
analysis to defamation law. More recent work focuses on the law’s effect on
media’sincentivestoinvestigateandreporttopicsofpublicinterest(Bar-Gill
&Hamdani,2003,Dalvi&Refalo,2008,Acheson&Wohlschlegel,2018)and
on political dishonesty (Garoupa, 1999a,b). As noted, this paper differs from
theseanalysesbyconsideringaBayesianaudience,alongsidedamagecapsand
judicialerrors.
Despitethesecontributions,courtsandlegalcommentatorsarelimitedtoa
fairlyrudimentaryunderstandingoftheincentivesfosteredbydifferentdefama-
tion law regimes. Here we amplify on two informal contributions that recog-
nizetherelevanceandimportanceofaudiencestotheanalysisofdefamation
law (Hemel & Porat, 2019, Arbel & Mungan, 2019). Methodologically, our
article borrows tools from the rich literature on signaling (Spence 1973) and
cheaptalk(Crawford&Sobel,1982).Ouranalysiscanalsobeinterpretedas

3. Model
We model the interactions between three parties: the speaker (S, she), the
target of the speech (T, he), and the audience, captured by a representative
member (A, it). A faces an informational problem: T is either a good or a
bad type, and A’s value of interacting with T depends on T’s type, which
is unknown to A. Before A decides whether to interact with the target, S,
who knows T’s type, communicates with A and may either disparage T or
makeanon-disparagingcomment.Becausewestudydefamation,weconsider
thepossibilitythatS mayfalselydisparageT inordertodeteraninteraction

After Nature determines the types of T and S, the target’s type becomes
commonknowledgeamongT andS(butnotA).Atthispoint,Schooseswhat
type of statement to send A regarding T’s type. The types of possible state-
ments follow defamation law’s distinction between disparaging statements,
which are potentially actionable, and non-disparaging statements, which are
non-actionable(e.g.,positiveremarks,silence,opinion,etc.).
Subsequently, A decides on whether to interact with T or to avoid him,
and, finally, T, decides whether to bring a lawsuit against S if a disparaging
remarkwasfollowedbyA’schoicetoavoidinteractingwithT.8 Wenotethat
this setting includes the possibility of T suing S, even if T is in fact a bad

3.3 EffectiveandIneffectiveCommunicationEquilibria
Perfect Bayesian Equilibria consist of assessments (i.e. a profile of beliefs
and strategies) that satisfy sequential rationality and consistency of beliefs.
SincetherequirementsforPBEarewellknown,werelegatetheirformaldef-
initions to Appendix A, below. As in many other contexts, communications
canbedisregardedbytheaudienceinsomeequilibria.Wedistinguishbetween
theseandothertypesofequilibriabyusingthefollowingdefinition.
Definition1APBEisaneffectivecommunicationequilibriumif,andonly
if,theaudiencechoosesnottointeractwiththetargetwithsomepositiveprob-
abilitybasedontheinformationitreceivesfromthespeaker.
We start by noting that defamation law cannot eliminate ineffective com-
munication equilibria. This is because when the audience’s beliefs regarding
the target’s types are unconditional on the speaker’s statement and equal to
its prior (i.e. x = x = γ), it chooses to interact with the target regardless
0 1
of what it hears from the target (i.e. a∗(z) = 0). This results in payoffs of 0
andrtothespeakerandtarget,respectively.Thesepayoffsareindependentof
the actions of the speaker and target, which makes them indifferent between
playing any of the strategies available to them. Thus, any assessment where
the speaker plays a strategy that supports the audience’s beliefs constitutes a
PBE.Thesimplestexampleisonewherethespeakerneverchoosestodispar-
agethetarget(i.e.s(t,v)=0foralltandv).Weformalizethisobservationas
follows.
Proposition 1. Under all defamation regimes, there exist ineffective com-
municationequilibria.
Proof. The assessment consisting of x∗ = x∗ = γ, a∗(z) = 0, s∗(t,v) =
(cid:26) 0 if q d⩽l/2 1 fort 0 ∈{B,G}
0, and p∗(t) = t satisfies sequential
1 if q d⩾l/2 fort∈{B,G}
t
rationality and consistency of beliefs (i.e. requirements 1-4 in Appendix A),
andthusisaPBE.
Proposition 1 notes that ineffective communication equilibria are always
present, regardless of the defamation regime in place. If these were the only
equilbria, defamation law would be irrelevant. Thus, we proceed by showing
thatsomelevelsofdamagesinfactgenerateeffectivecommunicationequilib-
ria.
Proposition 2. (i) Extremely low damages (i.e. d < l ) and extremely

ria. (ii) There exist a range of moderate damages, D ⊂ l , 2−l , which

tentlywiththespeaker’sstatement,i.e.a∗(z)=z,inalleffectivecommunica-
tionequilibria.

The intuition behind the first part of proposition 2 is relatively straightfor-
ward.Whendamagesareextremelylow,thetargetisdeterredfromsuingthe
speaker, even when he has a meritorious case, since expected damages (i.e.
q d)arelowerthanlitigationcosts.Thiscausesthespeaker’sstatementstobe
G
perceived as cheap-talk by the audience, since the speaker faces no negative
consequence from making disparaging statements. Thus, the audience disre-
gards the speaker’s statements and acts according to its priors. On the other
hand,whendamagesareextremelyhigh,alltargetsareincentivizedtolitigate,
andexpecteddamagesarehighenoughtodeterallspeakertypesfrommaking
disparaging statements. Thus, the audience is once again left without any in-
formativestatements,thistimeduetotheover-pricingofspeechasopposedto
thepresenceofcheap-talk.
Itisonlymoderatedamagesthatsupporteffectivecommunicationsbetween
speakers and audience members, and this is formalized in proposition 2-(ii).
Part (iii) of proposition 2 simply rules out the possibility of counter-intuitive
equilibria,forinstance,inwhichtheaudienceinfersfromadisparagingremark
thatthetargetmustbeagoodtypeandvice-versa(i.e.wherea∗(z)=1−z).
These preliminary findings indicate that if defamation laws are to have any
impact, theymustdosothrougheffectivecommunicationequilibriaobtained
under moderate damages. Thus, we analyze these equilibria in further detail,
next.

reduces the frequency with which speakers disparage a type B target. Thus,

4. WelfareAnalysis
Inanalyzingthesocialdesirabilityofdifferentdefamationregimes,weuse
a simple social welfare function which consists of the sum of each player’s
expectedpay-off.Weconductthiswelfareanalysistohighlightthethreemain
pointsthatweemphasizedintheintroduction.First,welfareisnon-monotonic
in damages for defamation. More precisely, we show that the shape of wel-
fare obtained through effective communication equilibria vis- a`-vis damages
resemblesaLafferCurve:welfareisincreasinginthelowerrangeofmoderate
damages (i.e. for d ∈ (dˆ,d )), is maximized in the intermediate range (i.e.
2
when d ∈ [d ,d ]), and is decreasing in the upper range of moderate dam-
2 3
ages (i.e. when d ∈ (d ,d )). Second, when there is a cap on damages (e.g.
3 4
reflecting the wealth of the defendant or a legal bound on permissible dam-
ages), then all effective defamation remedies may reduce welfare. Third, we
contrasttheimplicationsofamodelwithaBayesianversusana¨ıveaudience.
Whentheaudienceisna¨ıveandeasilymisledbyfalsestatements,typeGtar-
gets always prefer stricter defamation laws. The same is not true when the
audienceisBayesian,becauseabsentsizeabledamagestheaudienceperceives
the speaker’s disparaging statements as cheap-talk and disregards them. This
insight leads to a divergence between the normative implications of the two
models:withbindingcapsondamages,itmaybeoptimaltohavenodefama-
tionlawsatallwithaBayesianaudiencebutoptimaltohavemaximaldamages
withana¨ıveaudience.Next,weconsiderandformalizeeachofthesepoints.
4.1 TheLafferCurveofDefamationLaw
Underineffectivecommunicationequilibria,theaudienceactsaccordingto
its priors. Thus, it chooses to interact with the target regardless of the state-
ments by the speaker. There is no litigation since interaction always takes
place.Thus,expectedwelfareisindependentofdamages,andisgivenby
W ≡(1−γ)[r −b]+γ[r +g] (1)
I B G
On the other hand, under effective communication equilibria, the specific
functionalformofwelfarediffersdependingonwhichofthethreerangesdam-
agesarein,asexplainedtheprevioussection.Next,weconsiderwelfareunder
eachrange.
Withlowdamagesthatsupporteffectivecommunicationequilibria(i.e.d∈
(dˆ,d )), when the target is type B, the speaker disparages him, the audience

refuses to interact, and the target chooses not to litigate. Thus, with a proba-
bilityof(1−γ)expectedwelfareequalsthespeaker’sexpectedbenefitE[v].

alleged harm to the plaintiff. The rationale behind this result is that making

Thena¨ıveaudience, unliketheBayesianaudience, reliesonthestatementby

Whendamagespassontothemoderaterange,theequilibriumbehaviorand

equaltowelfarewithaBayesianaudience.
Inshort,themoststrikingdifferencearisingfromaswitchfromaBayesian

target to litigate (i.e. d ⩽ d ). The most prevalent normative impact of this

difference is observed when there is an upper bound on maximum damages,
since otherwise optimal equilibria are trivially obtained in the intermediate
moderate range (i.e. d ∈ [d ,d ]) under both models. Thus, we focus on the

5. ExtensionsandDiscussion
InSections3and4, wepresentedamodelthatallowedustoclearlyfocus
ondefamationlaws’impactontheaudience’sequilibriumbeliefsandactions.
In doing so, we abstracted from many issues that bear on the regulation of
information in more general settings, particularly, the possibility of there be-
ing a committed public enforcer, quality being endogenously chosen by the
target, the existence of honest and other types of speakers, and courts being
lessaccuratethanwepreviouslyassumed.Hereweturnourattentiontothese
issues.
5.1 EndogenousTypesandDynamicEfficiencies
In our analysis thus far, we assumed that the target’s type is exogenously
determined by nature to be either G or B with probabilities γ and 1−γ, re-
spectively. One might question the reality of this assumption, as people can

assumesthatthetarget’sbehaviorisimpactedbywhatlawsareinplace.Here,
we explain how the types in our setting can be endogenized, and how doing
so yields results similar to those in prior work where the target’s behavior is
endogenous.
One option of incorporating quality investments into our analysis is to re-
place Nature’s choice of types with a preliminary stage where the target, T,
makes a costly investment (c) that can increase her likelihood of becoming
a good type. Formally, we may assume that γ = γ(c) with γ′ > 0 > γ′′,
limγ′(c)=∞,γ(0)=γ and limγ(c)=γ where1>γ >γ >xˆ>0.

Proposition 2, which shows that with extreme laws, the audience acts based
on its priors and interacts with the target. Thus, investments have no private

investments in quality are socially valuable, as is implicitly assumed in the
literature (e.g., Garoupa 1999a,b), then increasing damages within the inter-

5.2 HonestSpeakersandEulogists
Existinganalysesofdefamationlawtypicallyassumethatthespeaker’sneg-
ative statement always harms the target, which is equivalent to the audience
being na¨ıve. Moreover, these analyses (e.g. Garoupa 1999a,b and Bar-Gill &
Hamdani2003)considerstrategicspeakerswhobenefitfromdefamingthetar-
get,andwhosebenefitsfromdoingsoareindependentoftheveracityoftheir
statements.Inreality,however,manyspeakersmaynothavesuchmotivations.
Quite importantly, many people, when asked their opinion, provide an hon-
est assessment of others. Moreover, there are also people who are motivated
by doing the exact opposite of what the speakers in our model are motivated
by; namely, promoting the relationship between the target and the audience.

valuefromspeakingtheirmind; and,eulogistsreceiveavaluefromtherebe-
inganinteraction.Therefore,solongascostsofsodoingarenothigh,dispar-
agers will badmouth the target and truth-speakers will reveal their true type.
Eulogists, in contrast, would always want to praise the target, as there is no
recourse under defamation law for false positive statements (the question of
whythisasymmetryexistsgoesbeyondthescopeofourarticle).
Theincorporationofthesetypesofspeakershasnoimpactontheobserva-
tionthatextremelystrongdefamationlawsleavetheaudiencetoactupontheir
priors. This follows, because once a critical threshold of damages is passed,
disparagers as well as truth speakers are deterred from making negative re-
marks.Thus,extremelystrongdefamationlawscausedisparagers,truthspeak-
ers, and eulogists alike to abstain from making negative statements, and the
audiencehasnooptionbuttoactaccordingtoitspriors.
The same cannot be said, however, for extremely weak defamation laws.
When damages are very low, targets lack an incentive to bring suit, making
talk cheap. Despite that, disparaging statements are still somewhat informa-
tive:Giventheexistenceofsometruth-speakers,thereissomeprobabilitythat
anynegativestatementistrue.Consequently,anaudiencethathearsanegative

ment as x∗ = γ ∆ where τ denotes the proportion of truth speakers,
1 ∆+(1−γ)τ
and ∆ is the proportion of disparagers. On the other hand, non-disparaging
remarksdonotnecessarilymeanthatT isagoodtype.Bysimilarlogic,there
is some probability that any given praise is false given the existence of eulo-
gists.Anaudiencewhichhearsapositivestatementevaluatesitsveracityasa

audience’sbeliefasx∗ =γ τ+ε ,whereεistheproportionofeulogists.

Using these observations it is easy to verify that, under lax laws, both dis-
paraging and non-disparaging statements are somewhat informative of types.
Inotherwords,non-disparagingstatementsaremoreindicativeofgoodtypes
than no information at all (x∗ > γ), and disparaging statements are more

Still,eveninthepresenceofeulogistsanddisparagers,imperfectlyinformative

5.3 CommitmentandPublicEnforcement
Our analysis so far focused on private enforcement of defamation laws,
where the target is the one to sue. However, private parties will only bring
alawsuitifitpaystodosoex-post, andthiscalculusexposesthemtostrate-
gicbehaviorbywould-bedefamers.Incontrast,someparties,typicallypublic

The commitment to bringing a lawsuit also changes the speaker’s behav-
ior, as a lawsuit is possible even when expected damages are low. We next
explainthebehaviorofthespeakerineffectivecommunicationequilibria,un-
der three different damages ranges, and subsequently compare them with the
correspondingbehaviorunderprivateenforcement.
Asunderprivateenforcement,itfollowsthatwhendamagesareveryhigh,
i.e.,d>d˜,alldisparagingremarksaredeterred.However,whend∈(d˜,d˜),

the speaker refrains from disparaging good types, but disparages bad types
wheneverhervaluefromblockinginteractionsissufficientlyhigh(i.e.v˜ (d)≡

in this range, a disparaging remark conclusively reveals to the audience that

damages are low, i.e., d < d˜, the speaker is no longer necessarily deterred
2
from disparaging good types, and chooses to defame the target if her value
from blocking interactions exceeds v˜ ≡ p(q d− l). Thus, it follows that
G B 2
0<1−F(v˜ (d))<1−F(v˜ (d)),and,therefore,0<x∗ <γ <x∗ <1.

We can now compare defamation laws under public and private enforce-
mentregimes.First,effectivecommunicationequilibriaarenotpossibleunder
either regime when damages are extremely high (i.e. higher than d˜ and d
4 4
in the public and private regimes, respectively). Thus, our previous conclu-
sion regarding the ineffectiveness of high damages in supporting informative
statementsextendstothepublicenforcementcaseaswell.
Second, unlike private enforcement, public enforcement can sustain effec-
tivecommunicationequilibriaevenwithlowdamages.Underprivateenforce-
ment, the speaker will anticipate that the target will not sue if damages are
sufficiently low. This can lead the speaker to disparage regardless of the tar-
get’s type, which would make statements non-informative. With public en-
forcement, however, there is always a risk of a lawsuit, thus deterring some
would-bedefamersandsustainingthereliabilityofsomestatements.Thisim-
pliesthat,unlikeintheprivateenforcementcontext,verylowdamagescanbe
usedtosupporteffectivecommunicationequilibria—atleastwhenthethresh-

Third, and quite importantly, it is impossible to obtain an equilibrium that

6. Conclusion
Existing economic analyses of defamation law typically assume that there
are no obstacles in the way of a person who wishes to harm another person
throughdefamatorystatements.However,forsuchharmstoberealized,people
must find the derogatory statements made by the person credible. The credi-
bility of these statements, in turn, depend on what types of consequences a
speaker faces by making such statements. Defamation law is a tool that can
be used to alter these consequences, and therefore the credibility of negative
statements.Wehaveformalizedthisdynamicbystudyingthebeliefformation
processofpeoplewhoaretherecipientsofsuchinformation.
Our analysis has revealed several interesting dynamics. When courts are
accurateandthemaximumrecoverabledamagesfromthedefendantarelarge,
onecanlargelyeliminatefalsespeech.However,whentheseconditionsdonot
hold,itispossiblefortheregulationofspeechthroughdefamationlawtocause
more harm than benefits. This may occur because the credibility of speech

toanincreaseinfalsenegativespeechwhichisbelievedbytheaudience(and
thismayalsoleadtosignificantlitigationcosts).Inothercases,itpossiblefor
the increased informativeness obtained through defamation law to outweigh
its social costs. Which of these two cases is obtained depends, among other
things,ontheharminflictedtothetargetofspeech.
Onereasonwhytheseconclusionshavenotbeendevelopedinthevastlegal
literatureonthetopicispresumablytheinsufficientattentionpaidtotherole
of audiences, which have typically assumed to be na¨ıve. We believe that our
basic insights are also applicable to many other areas of law where the goal
is to regulate the veracity of information. Although our analysis represents a

Suppose there is a PBE where a∗(z) = 1 − z for all z, then per R3,

Suppose there is a PBE where a∗(z) = 1for all z. If µ(s∗) = i ∈ {0,1},
