## Elevator pitch

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that "contract creep" represents the subtle, gradual extension of contractual terms into previously non-contractual spheres of social life, such as casual online interactions and the use of everyday products. He contends that this phenomenon, often propelled by boilerplate language and digital agreements, reconfigures social relationships and norms, frequently occurring without explicit consent or public awareness, thus fundamentally altering societal interactions.
