Okay, here's the bullet list based on the provided text:

*   **Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a debtor's wealth significantly influences their decision to shield assets, as wealthier individuals would need to shield a larger volume of assets at greater cost for it to be effective against creditors. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his paper develops a theory of asset shielding to explain this behavior, arguing that richer debtors often find it irrational to shield, while poorer debtors pose a higher shielding risk which impacts credit markets.**

1.  ## TL;DR ≤100 words
    Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that debtor wealth dictates asset shielding decisions. His theory posits that wealthier debtors often find shielding large asset volumes too costly and thus irrational. Conversely, poorer debtors present a higher shielding risk. This dynamic, where shielding is more rational for poorer debtors, significantly influences credit markets.

    Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a debtor's wealth is a key determinant in their choice to shield assets from creditors. He notes that for wealthier individuals, the sheer volume of assets requiring protection, and the associated costs, can make shielding an ineffective or irrational strategy. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his paper introduces a theory of asset shielding to elucidate these behaviors. This theory suggests that while richer debtors may forego shielding, poorer debtors are more likely to engage in it, thereby creating a higher shielding risk that has repercussions for credit markets.
