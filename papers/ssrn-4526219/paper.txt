Generative Interpretation
Yonathan A. Arbel & David A. Hoffman*
99 N.Y.U. L. REV. __ (forthcoming 2024)
[DRAFT October 27, 2023]
We introduce generative interpretation, a new approach to estimating contractual meaning
using large language models. As AI triumphalism is the order of the day, we proceed by way
of grounded case studies, each illustrating the capabilities of these novel tools in distinct
ways. Taking well-known contracts opinions, and sourcing the actual agreements that they
adjudicated, we show that AI models can help factfinders ascertain ordinary meaning in con-
text, quantify ambiguity, and fill gaps in parties’ agreements. We also illustrate how models
can calculate the probative value of individual pieces of extrinsic evidence.
After offering best practices for the use of these models given their limitations, we consider
their implications for judicial practice and contract theory. Using large language models per-
mits courts to estimate what the parties intended cheaply and accurately, and as such gener-
ative interpretation unsettles the current interpretative stalemate. Their use responds to ef-
ficiency-minded textualists and justice-oriented contextualists, who argue about whether
parties will prefer cost and certainty or accuracy and fairness. Parties—and courts—would
prefer a middle path, in which adjudicators strive to predict what the contract really meant,
admitting just enough context to approximate reality while avoiding unguided and biased
assimilation of evidence. As generative interpretation offers this possibility, we argue it can
become the new workhorse of contractual interpretation.

INTRODUCTION
When New Orleans’ levees broke during Hurricane Katrina, devastation, both hu-
man and economic, swept the city. And then came the lawyers. In mass contract litigation
by policyholders against their insurance companies, advocates fighting over tens of billions
of dollars of potential liability ultimately contested the meaning of a single word, represent-
ing a concept the companies had excluded from coverage: Flood.1 Plaintiffs labored first to
convince judges that flood might not mean water damage caused by humans, so they could
then prove to a factfinder that their insurance policies didn’t contemplate damage resulting
from negligence by the Army’s Corps of Engineers.2 Lawyers for the defense argued that the

word was unambiguous in context, covering rising waters no matter their cause, and there-
fore no further factfinding was necessary.3 Here, as so often in real court proceedings, though
rarely in law school classrooms, expensive, cumbersome and unsatisfactory processes of con-
tract interpretation took center stage.4
After years of litigation, the Fifth Circuit—in the best-known and most consequen-
tial contracts case of the last generation5—held that flood was unambiguous: It meant any
inundation, regardless of cause.6 To get to that outcome, it engaged in the most artisanal and
articulated form of textualism available in late-stage Capitalism. The court consulted four
dictionaries, one encyclopedia, two treatises, a medley of for-and-against, in-and-out-of-ju-
risdiction cases, and two linguistic, latinized interpretative canons.7 That’s on top of the four
dictionaries and twenty reporter pages of caselaw analyzing the same problem in the district
court.8
Notwithstanding such expensive and extensive efforts, the court’s interpretation has
come under attack: its dictionary analysis was misleading,9 its canons badly deployed,10 and

some of the relevant legal authorities were in fact pro-plaintiff.11 Rather than reach a deci-
sion that followed from a constraining method, the Fifth Circuit (says its critics) merely
affirmed its pro-business priors.12 If textualism looks like another infinitely malleable and
justificatory practice in high stakes cases, what good is it? But textualism’s competitor,
kitchen-sink contextualism, has been in bad odor for two generations, at least for the sorts
of contracts that generally get litigated.13 Thus, contract jurists muddle along, looking for a
better, more convenient path.14
In this article we offer a new approach to determining contracting parties’ meaning,
which we’ll call generative interpretation.15 The idea is simple: applying large language

models (LLMs) to contractual texts and extrinsic evidence to predict what the parties
would have said at contracting about what they meant.16 Our goal is to convince you that
generative interpretation avoids some of the problems that bedeviled the Fifth Circuit in its
Katrina litigation, while being materially more accessible and transparent. Giving courts a
convenient way to commit to a cheap and predictable contract interpretation methodology
would be a major advance in contract law, and parties may start to include them in their
choice-of-law repertoire. We argue that even today’s freshly-minted LLMs can be of service.
Convincing judges to forgo dictionaries and canons and adopt a chat tool best
known today for encouraging lawyers to submit fake authorities will be a tall order.17 We’ll
largely proceed by way of demonstrative case studies. Let’s start with the word flood. In the
Katrina case, the question was really whether the widely shared meaning of flood reasonably
excluded manmade disasters. To answer that question you could, as the court did, turn to
the traditional tools of High Textualism.18 Or you could survey insured citizens (if you could
identify them and avoid motivated answers).19 And you might even, if you were technically
sophisticated and patient enough, query a few relatively small databases and ask which words
in English generally tend to occur, or collocate, with flood in newspapers, books, and the
like.20
But we instead turned to a convenient, free, open-source LLM tool resting on a da-
tabase of trillions of words and asked it to transform words into complex vectors in a process
called embedding.21 As a first cut, this process can be thought of as trying to quantify how
much a word or phrase belongs to a given category, or dimension. Thus, if there is a

oping new ways of interacting with large language models and incorporating context and attention mecha-
nisms.

GITHUB, https://github.com/yonathanarbel/generativeinterpretation/tree/main (last visited Sep. 6,
2023).The exclusion term is the language contained at footnote 1, supra. Because embeddings are vectors in
high-dimensional space, we can measure the distance between them. This method has been used extensively in
the literature. See Choi, supra note 16, at 24–26 (using method and reports its usage and limitations.) For a
non-legal example, see e.g., Nitika Mathur, Timothy Baldwin & Trevor Cohn, Putting Evaluation in Context:
Contextual Embeddings Improve Machine Translation Evaluation, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 57TH ANNUAL
MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS 2799 (2019). We found that while re-
sults using this method seem sensible, they are also fragile. To create a more robust measure, we relied on the
embeddings of the ten top performing models today (found at https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leader-
board on pair classification tasks) and used similar sentence structures. This approach is partly inspired by
Maria Antoniak & David Mimno, Evaluating the Stability of Embedding-based Word Similarities, 6 TRANS.

it, and reported the results in the figure below. For an elaboration on the limitations of these techniques, see

driven by wind or not . . .”) and various terms and phrases.
To read Figure 1, focus on the location of the red markers. The further they are from
the origin, the more distant the model considers the semantic relationship between the
phrases.23 In our view, the Figure offers immediately available, objective, cheap support for
the court’s judgment that floods can be unnaturally caused. Common sentences regarding
floods do not distinguish between the type of cause, but seem more focused on its typicality.
Our quality checks, flood caused by tears of joy or police, are indeed farther out than flood
caused by heavy rainfall or a severe storm.24 And while it supports this decision of the court,
it challenges another. Louisiana courts refused to exclude water main floods, even though
linguistically they appear to be as much of a flooding event as any other.25
Now, the model doesn’t provide (nor could it) a scientific answer to the question of
whether words are sufficiently close to make the plain meaning of flood unambiguous. But
there is a bit of difference between an informed conclusion based on a statistical analysis of
billions of texts and a judgment by a few dictionary editors. And there is an ocean of differ-
ence between the baroque and expensive textualism the court used and code that is cheap,
replicable, quick, and most importantly, extremely straightforward to use. Simply put, gen-
erative interpretation is good enough for many cases that currently employ more expensive,
and arguably less certain, methodologies. It's a workable, workmanlike method for a re-
source-constrained contract litigation world.
In Part I, we introduce the methodologies of contract interpretation and argue that
they badly fail at their core purposes of unbiased, accessible ascertainment of what the parties
would have wanted. In practice, interpretation operates as a kludgy prediction engine. Both
textualism and contextualism strive to estimate what the parties would have said on a matter,
accounting for realistic constraints of evidence and cost. But those constraints impose real
tradeoffs and can’t avoid legitimacy problems generated by courts’ motivated reasoning.26
23 The models we use here specialize in creating embeddings that can measure the semantic textual similarity
of sentences and words. For technical background, see Jianmo Ni, Gustavo Hernández Ábrego, Noah Con-
stant, Ji Ma, Keith B. Hall, Daniel Cer, and Yinfei Yang, Sentence-T5: Scalable Sentence Encoders from Pre-
trained Text-to-Text Models, arXiv:2108.08877 (2021)

GENERATIVE INTERPRETATION
We describe some modern proposed improvements on interpretation’s normal science and
suggest that however promising they are, concerns about usability and cost impair their real-
world utility.27
Part II is the heart of the Article. Here, we look at several types of interpretative
problems generated by real contracts that produced contracts opinions. These range from
the easy (what is the predicted meaning of a particular word?), to the hard (is there an am-
biguity?), to the metaphysical (what did the parties mean when they clearly hadn’t consid-
ered the issue?). In each example, we showcase new ways to use large language models to
sharpen intuitions about the parties’ presumed intent, to illuminate how transparent and
objective interpretative methodologies have advantages over intuitive ones, and to suggest
that generative interpretation has real promise as a judicial adjunct. The cases we run
through include casebook staples, like Trident Ctr. v. Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co.28 and
C & J Fertilizer, Inc. v. Allied Mut. Ins. Co.,29 as well as some that should be, like Famiglio
v. Famiglio,30 Haines v. City of New York,31 and Stewart v. Newbury.32 For many of these
cases, our work is based on archival research identifying original contract materials, until
now obscured by the judicial opinions that purportedly interpret them.
These case studies show how generative interpretation might be deployed in prac-
tice. As we will explore, the technology underlying large language models can do more than
merely help us see if flood is closer to levee than it is to joy. Dictionaries, encyclopedias, or
corpus linguistics can do that. What makes large language models powerful is the vastness of
the data they incorporate; what makes them unique is that they wield an internal mechanism
known as “attention” which allows them to account for to context. And by becoming con-
text sensitive, these models can parse the effects of contract text from the marginal value of
relevant extrinsic evidence

But current practices about LLMs and their future uses are contingent: Lawyers
tend to use tools before they are theoretically sharp.33 In Part III, we develop a theory to
justify and constrain generative interpretation going forward, as the technology that enables
it continues to rapidly develop and its use by lawyers and judges grows explosively. We make
two claims.
First, the method fills a glaring need for a simple, transparent, and convenient way
to commit to an interpretative method that helps predict the parties’ intent. If courts follow
the set of best practices we describe, they will avoid certain access-to-justice and legitimacy
problems that have beset the modern contract litigation machine. Second, rather than
simply a marginal improvement over dictionary-and-canon textualism, or its negation as a
form of 1960s-California contextualism,34 use of artificial intelligence (AI) should prompt
a top-to-bottom reexamination of the assumptions justifying these approaches to interpre-
tation. As more courts commit to generative interpretation, parties may come to prefer con-
textual evaluation of meaning when their deals are evaluated, thus flipping a longstanding
default rule in contract law.35
We do consider some of the developing objections to the use of large language mod-
els, including their hallucinatory errors, biases, black-box methods, and the tension between
the rapidity of their deployment and stately needs of precedential decision-making. As we
show, generative interpretation’s dangers illustrate its limits: Judges will have to use these
engines as tools to excavate the normative judgments on which all interpretative and adju-
dicatory exercises rest. Large language models aren’t robot judges. What they will do (and
maybe are already doing) is help judges illuminate the degree to which we want to give the
parties what they really bargained for, as best as we can.

Jurists interpreting contracts start with a simple question: “what would the parties

have said about the meaning of a disputed phrase at the time they entered the contract?”36
That is, to “ascertain the parties’ intention at the time [the parties] made their contract.”37
As Alan Schwartz and Bob Scott noted in their canonical article, Contract Theory and the
Limits of Contract Law, this question in theory has a “correct answer.”38 In practice,
however, it is not always easy or possible to know what it is. Lacking a time machine,
adjudicators traditionally have stitched together an answer using imperfect evidence—a mix
of the contract’s text, the parties’ statements about the deal (whether from before, during,
or after its formation),39 market data,40 and some hunches about fairness and efficiency

enforcing. Cf. Eyal Zamir, The Inverted Hierarchy of Contract Interpretation and Supplementation, 97

ICS AND THE LAW 585 (Peter Newman ed., 1998) (reviewing the economic theories for the design of default
rules). It is inevitable that the parties at times will choose not to think about a relevant possibility to minimize
transaction costs or permit a deal. Therefore, when we say that the goal is prediction, consider it the beginning,
rather than the end, of interpretation.

backward and predict what the parties would have said they meant.43 This seems
straightforward, akin to the retrospective intent-based inquiries we see in criminal law and
tort. Nonetheless, interpretation is “the least settled, most contentious area of
contemporary contract doctrine and scholarship.”44 That’s because of the many problems it
seeks to solve. As Greg Klass puts it, jurists ask (1) whose meaning counts, (2) what type of
meaning matters (local/majoritarian, semantic/pragmatic), and (3) what facts determine
the legally relevant meaning.45 These questions map, imperfectly, onto distinctions between
textualists and contextualists. And, at the bottom of the well, contractual interpretation
resolves questions of claims to judicial power, and thus legitimates violence.46 The result is
that parties contesting how to interpret contracts are sometimes arguing about what
outcomes are just, not merely which are more likely to lead to parties getting what they want.
But putting aside normative questions, even basic operational empirics about
interpretation—the prediction questions everyone agrees are at the core—are hard.
Prediction is difficult, and mistakes are inevitable. Accuracy—in the sense of thinking that
we really got as close as we could to knowing what the parties would have said—trades off
against cost and certainty. Efficiency-minded scholars have repeatedly argued that as the
amount of evidence offered to prove the parties’ contemporaneous-to-contracting meaning
increased, so does expense across several domains.47
As a first cut at that cost, consider that when parties are permitted to adduce addi-
tional sources of interpretative evidence, they also increase the range of defensible answers
from the tribunal. This means that it becomes harder to know what the factfinder will do—
their ability to choose unexpected meanings waxes with the evidentiary inputs.48 But worse,

both parties and factfinders are motivated in how they offer and process evidence.49 In a
regime that permits more evidence, parties will offer evidence that favors their view, some-
times unconsciously motivated to avoid presenting data that favors the other side;50 fact-
finders, equally subject to motivated cognition, will process new evidence in biased ways.51
At the same time, as the types of evidence relevant to contract interpretation become
more capacious, parties will seek to introduce more evidence at trial, raising the costs of
litigation.52 These costs may be significant, even in dispute resolution forums like arbitration
that are built to resolve cases quickly and cheaply.53 The interpretation arms race has led
scholars to model when parties would prefer to spend money ex ante on more specified text,
rather than spend ex post on litigation.54 That is, to pre-commit to methodologies which are
less accurate but more efficient.

developed two basic methods to solve for the predictive question in the absence of the ability
to travel to the time of contracting.55 These methods, textualism and contextualism, are
represented in the real world by the courts in New York and California, respectively.56
New York’s textualist judges focus on the contract: They take its words as the
canonical source of the parties’ meaning and abjure other sources of evidence as predictive
grist. Textualists try to use the common sense meaning of words, using dictionaries to obtain
the public meaning of the words the parties chose, and grammatical and lexical tools to
understand how the words, when collated, create obligation.57 Textualism has known
advantages, including forcing the parties to think carefully about what they mean, and to use
contract words in ordinary ways.58 This ideological approach to contract interpretation
resembles that same concept in statutory and constitutional interpretation;59 though it is
less politically valanced, it is equally ascendent.60
The linguistic textualist project has long been controversial. To begin with, the
method of brute sense plain meaning primes judges to overconfidently believe that their
beliefs and conclusions are more common than they in fact are.61 As Arthur Corbin put it
long ago, “when a judge reads the words of a contract he may jump to the instant and
confident opinion that they have but one reasonable meaning and that he knows what it

is.”62 Empirical work—experimental63 and sociological64—has since found that judges doing
plain meaning analysis disagree with each other and with lawyers about things they thought
obvious.
Critics also charge textualists with incoherence about ambiguity.65 To reach the safe
shoals of plain meaning, textualists ask first if the language is unambiguous.66 But while tex-
tualism provides tools to discover ambiguities, in practice, critics charge, it fails to prioritize
one plausible interpretation over the other. It appears to simplify interpretative disputes, but
in reality sometimes facilitates expensive, biased battles over extrinsic evidence.67
But even outside of ambiguity, textualism’s basic methodological tools are
remarkably underdeveloped. Scholars often blame the humble dictionary.68 Courts doing

textualism are sometimes reversed for failing to use one.69 But it’s an imprecise tool for
discerning the parties’ intent at the drafting stage. Selecting between dictionaries is a value-
laden act,70 and even within a single volume, dictionaries do not provide a single plain, or
majoritarian, meaning of words.71 Critically, dictionary definitions are blind even to internal
context, those other parts of the document or statute that textualists do embrace.72 As Kevin
Tobia demonstrated, definitions can be poor trackers of actual usage, a point well
understood by anyone not adding tomatoes to a fruit salad.73
Dictionary-thumping jurists face two opposing critiques: They bind themselves too
much,74 but also too little.75 The first strips the judicial process of its nuanced nature, the
latter breeds gamesmanship and bias.76 This critique is (to be fair) a little overheated. Sure,
judges take dictionaries seriously,77 but they also freely admit that dictionaries are not “in-
fallible.”78 Even Learned Hand cautioned, “it is one of the surest indexes of a mature and
developed jurisprudence not to make a fortress out of the dictionary.”79 Dictionaries are nor-
mally under-determinative of outcomes, and this is a virtue rather than a vice. As we shall
claim, this virtue is equally shared by generative interpretation.
Similarly, the canons of interpretation themselves are difficult to defend

empirically.80 These canons are traditionally known by their evocative Latin names—in pari
materie, expressio unius est exclusio alterius, ejusdem generis, contra proferentem, generalia
specialibus non derogant—and they are used to fill dictionaries’ gaps.81 They try to address
the problem of context by giving heuristics to parse the parties’ proffered meanings.82
Popular with judges but absent from the Restatement,83 scholars criticize them as essentially
ad hoc.84 There is no obvious way to know what to do when different canons lead to
different outcomes, meaning that they offer the same kinds of degrees of freedom as
dictionaries do.
Nor is it clear that the contractual linguistic canons are rooted in how parties think
or write.85 The extant empirical work on linguistic canons in statutory interpretation
suggests that the answer is: they might be, but only some of the time.86 Now, to be sure, some

have understood the contract at drafting (if that has a stable meaning in contracts deployed
to millions of adherents). These normative canons may, or may not, relate to the parties’
contemporaneous intentions.87 But other canons are intended to reflect ordinary uses of
language, and yet have been subject to remarkably little controlled scrutiny.88
Notwithstanding its methodological shortcomings, contract textualism is ever more
popular.89 That’s so for a whole host of reasons, but none more so than the weakness of its
main conceptual rival: contextualism. This familiar alternative starts with the same premise
as textualism: What would the parties have said they meant had we asked them at the time
of contracting? But contextualism invites parties to offer extrinsic evidence to build depth
into the predictive analysis. By doing so, contextualism seeks to privilege accuracy—the
parties’ real intended meaning.
This approach to interpretation, capacious in the types of evidence considered
relevant, found its heyday in the 1960s in California and has never been as popular since.90
The problem with the approach, according to its critics, is that it does not permit the parties
to know what meaning a court will assign to the words they write, since the other side can
always offer self-serving meanings ex post and, if believable enough, write a new bargain in
court to replace the one drafted in the past.91 Even contextualism’s origin story is one of a
party suddenly remembering that they actually meant to make the purchase option available
only to family members, creditors be damned.92 Contextualism makes it difficult to lock
down meaning ex ante, through merger clauses and the like, which are always subject to later
testimonial refutation. Contextualism’s consumer protection allure is understandable.93 But

even if contextualism could offer more accuracy, critics charge it does so at a high cost.94
Indeed, scholars often defend textualism on efficiency grounds.95 Though it may be
unclear what parties want interpretative rules to be, it’s almost certainly the case that lawyer-
drafters prefer textualist to contextualist modes of decision. Eric Posner captures the idea
well: Parties will often include an explicit merger clause, but few ever bother with an “anti-
merger clause.”96 Thus, from the perspective of the litigated cases—those between rich and
lawyered parties—contextualism is simply harder to defend.
And yet, from a certain perspective, contextualism seems well-positioned for a
revival. Recall that even contextualism’s critics agree about first-order goal: to figure out
what the parties would have meant at contracting. The problems with contextualism are
largely centered around motivated testimony and cost, which persuades the factfinder to
ignore the text. But consider: We increasingly live in a world where our thoughts are
recorded contemporaneously, whether sent by text, posted on social media, or recorded on
TikTok. Such recorded, immutable utterances are cheap to reproduce and appear to courts
to be excellent sources of contractual meaning.97 Defenders of textualism may argue that
permitting their use creates uncertainty, but some of the best arguments against

contextualism—that it can be abused ex post—are weaker than they used to be.98 And yet,
we lack a method to know which excited utterances to privilege, and we should worry that
courts’ motivated reading will cause them to come to inaccurate or biased understandings.
The debate between textualism and contextualism is old, and scholars have offered
various theoretical lenses by which one or the other approach ought to prevail.99 Most
arguments for or against extrinsic evidence turn on hypotheses about what parties would
have wanted (had we asked them) and which methods promote social welfare. These
arguments are often theoretically rich but empirically poor.100
More recently, scholars have offered two new methods, both advancing the certainty
values of textualism with a dash of the accuracy interests of contextualism. One school
focuses on the use of corpora of words to predict the meaning of phrases in contractual
texts—so-called corpus linguistics.101 To take the prototypical example, consider the
following phrase taken from an insurance contract:
[T]his insurance does not apply to ‘bodily injury’ [including death] to any person
while practicing for or participating in any sports or athletic contest or exhibition
that you sponsor.102
An insured dies while snorkeling: Is that a “sports or athletic contest”? As Stephen
Mouritsen observes, the question is not easily answerable using the classic dictionary-and-
canon based tools of textualism. And, considering that insurance contracts are drafted by
powerful firms, who subject them to regulatory scrutiny, the idea of using extrinsic expres-
sions by either firms or the insured seems hopeless.103 Instead, Mouritsen suggests that courts
could (helped by adversarial presentation by parties) query language databases to establish
whether sports and snorkeling appear relatively close to each other in some number of pre-
vious examples. That is, to derive the meaning of the word from its common use in previous

is swimming wearing a goofy mask.)104
Corpus linguistics is an advance over traditional textualism or contextualism. It pro-
vides a methodology that theoretically allows courts to adhere to an objective set of responses
when determining the ordinary meaning of words based on their actual usage. Essentially,
it’s a form of textualism that doesn’t rely on dictionary definitions or a battery of canons. It
mirrors not the static decisions of lexicographers in their secluded, book-filled offices, but
rather the public use of words—democratized textualism.105
But corpus linguistics is inattentive to context.106 It can only really compare brief
snippets of text, rather than whole documents. Thus, although the method has been repeat-
edly used in statutory interpretation cases—where the stakes are high, parties are commonly
engaged in interpretative battles over short phrases—only one contracts opinion to date has
applied the method.107
A different constraining approach, advanced by Omri Ben-Shahar and Lior Strahi-
levitz, encourages courts to use survey evidence to decide on the public meaning of certain
contractual texts.108 As they point out, this survey evidence is a second best to the predictive
ideal we described above:
Contracts should have the meaning that the parties to the transaction assign
to the text. [But] it is pointless to ask the actual parties in the litigation what
the text meant to them when they formed the contract, because they will

bend their answers to fit their litigation goals. So the law should instead ask
disinterested people just like them.109
The authors defend this interesting proposal against various charges.110 Their core
survey case is consumer contracts designed for mass audiences.111 There, the survey audience
and the original adherents are the same people (although separated by time), and we should
have fewer worries about the parties intending idiosyncratic meanings.112 But outside of that
frame, a problem with the survey approach is that for most litigated contract cases—i.e.,
commercial cases—the relevant survey audience will be difficult to find, as sophisticated ad-
herents don’t take surveys, or will game them, producing the same problems encumbering
contextualism.113
Survey evidence is also an expensive adjudicatory technology. Surveys themselves are
difficult to conduct: Judges would need to rely on their adversarial presentation in the ordi-
nary case. And they are increasingly unreliable: Recent work has found that almost a third
of online survey respondents use LLMs to complete answers.114 Surveys based on more col-
lated samples face the same sorts of problems that have bedeviled modern polling: Nonre-
sponse bias among parts of the population, difficulties of generalization, and inaccuracy.
And even here, attention is scarce. It is hard to survey consumers on a twenty-page policy or
to expect anyone filling out a survey for a $5 gift card to attentively consider interdependen-
cies within the contract.
Consequently, though survey methodology is an established technique in trademark
cases and could very well be of enormous help in making sense of the meaning of certain
consumer contracts, it is unlikely to be a transformative technology in the ordinary contract
interpretation case. We are unaware of any cases to date that permit the use of survey evi-
dence to determine contractual meaning.

GENERATIVE INTERPRETATION
In summary, notwithstanding broad agreement about the predictive goal of inter-
pretation, there’s also a shared sense that there’s something amiss in how jurists balance ac-
curacy and efficiency. Textualism promises the latter, but in practice it often merely super-
charges the judge’s own overconfident priors. Contextualism promises the former, but prob-
ably doesn’t deliver it, while eroding parties’ ability to plan for court outcomes and making
litigation prohibitively expensive for all but the wealthiest parties. The two most sophisti-
cated modern improvements on these old technologies—statistical plain meaning and sur-
vey evidence—promise to rescue textualism from some of its sins, but haven’t been taken up
in live cases.
Enter large language models.
II. GENERATIVE INTERPRETATION
The doctrine of reasonable expectations plays a contested role in the regulation
of insurance contracts.115 For some courts, the insured’s reasonable expectations trump
the insurance contract’s terms, while for many others, the policy’s plain language should
control.116 Notoriously, these sorts of cases motivate armchair speculation by judges—
whose life experience, education, sophistication, and hard-earned cynicism systematically di-
verge from most lay people. Worse, the interpretations we give words appear very certain in
our own minds. Contract interpretation is a prime subject for a phenomenon psychologists
call “false consensus bias.”117 To illustrate the effect, Lawrence Solan, Terry Rosenblatt and
Daniel Osherton presented contract interpretation questions to both laypeople and judges.
After giving their opinion, the authors asked subjects to estimate how many other partici-
pants would agree with them. This design allows us to compare the actual distribution of
answers with how people expected the distribution to look. The results were striking: Both

laypeople and judges overestimated how common their chosen interpretations were. Judges
even overestimated how much other judges would agree with them.118
Thus, one of the risks of introspective interpretation is that its products are very
sticky and hard to dislodge. This leads to dissent and reversal, and of course, interpretation
that defies parties’ reasonable expectations. Uncertainty about common interpretation is an
appealing case for the use of surveys.119 And surveys would be of great interpretative use,
were it not for the practical difficulties which we’ve just discussed.
Consider C & J Fertilizer v. Allied Mutual.120 The president of C&J, a fertilizer firm,
purchased a burglary insurance policy from Allied Mutual. The discussions preceding the
purchase made it clear that the policy would not cover an inside job. The insurance firm in
the negotiations tried to insist that to bring a claim, C&J would have to present hard evi-
dence that a theft was made by a stranger.121 That idea was embodied in the following prom-
ise in the insurance contract:
[Allied will pay for] the felonious abstraction of insured property (1) from
within the premises by a person making felonious entry therein by actual
force and violence, of which force and violence there are visible marks made
by tools, explosives, electricity or chemicals . . . .122
As it turns out, a burglar robbed the fertilizer plant with style. While leaving some
tread marks in the mud, he avoided leaving any other visible signs before absconding with
$50,000 worth of fertilizer. The insurance company, denying the claim, argued that by its
plain language, the absence of visible marks made by tools (as opposed to tires) meant that
it didn’t have to pay.
The Iowa Supreme Court, in a contracts casebook staple, held that the exclusion
applied in this way violated the insured’s reasonable expectations. No one could have rea-
sonably expected that burglary would be limited only to those leaving visible entry marks.123

In reaching that view, the court relied on its own common sense with no empirical ground-
ing. Was it right?
That question triggers the simplest use cases of LLMs as part of the interpretative
process. The judge can simply ask the model for its assessment. Fantastical only three years
ago, today you might be merely whelmed by the model’s ability to respond coherently and
plausibly to this query. Here’s the model’s response, edited for readability:124
An insurance policy reads: "[The insurance company will pay for] the felonious abstraction of insured property (1) from
within the premises by a person making felonious entry therein by actual force and violence, of which force and violence
there are visible marks made by tools, explosives, electricity or chemicals." With this in mind, please state your prediction—
with the associated numerical level of confidence in parentheses—on the likely expectations of most policyholders under
these terms for the following propositions:
Table 1: GPT-4's estimates of propositions regarding the likely content of the gap in the
policy.
In other words, the model disagreed here with the court’s majority opinion. It (like
a dissenting opinion) predicts that policyholders would have expected to be required to pro-
vide some evidence of forceful entry to prove that the burglary was not an inside job.
To us these findings are facially plausible: they validate that this cheap and conven-
ient tool could be potentially of use in real cases. But just because the probabilities are rea-
sonable doesn't mean they are accurate. Your intuition should be: prove it! You would want
to know more, both about what the model is doing when it produces percentages, and how
left on the exterior of the premises. This escape clause, here triggered by the burglar's talent . . . was never read
to or by plaintiff's personnel, nor was the substance explained by defendant's agent.”).

that methodology fits courts’ purposes in interpreting insurance contracts.125 Let’s start
there, in Part II.A. We’ll then try some more complicated examples in the remainder of this
Section.
A. A Gentle Introduction to Large Language Models
When Chat GPT-4 told us that it was 90% likely that the policy would pay in re-
sponse to a “substantiated third-party burglary,” what happened behind the curtain? We’re
going to give an explanation a shot here, knowing that doing so is difficult in part because
LLM technology is complex and rapidly changing. Essentially, LLMs create a statistical
model of how words connect by training on torrents of existing texts, some historic and
some artificially derived.126
In the common case, LLMs take user input in the form of text and produce an out-
put, also in the form of text. Behind the scenes, the model takes the text and transforms it
into numbers. This is essential, because (superficially) computers do not read text. Numbers
can encode more information than letters, and they are more valuable in that they allow
computers to perform mathematical operations. This is easy to see in the case of ambiguities:
Duck is both a verb and a noun. But in a number system, we can use prefixes like 20 for verbs
and 10 for nouns, so we can encode the word duck twice. One is, say, 201 and the other 101,
to designate the disparate meanings and disambiguate them.127
This simple illustration understates the utility of this process, known as embed-
ding.128 Rather than assigning a single number to each word, machine learning models trans-
form them into strings of number-pairs—each pair capturing some aspects of meaning.129
The length of such vectors is very long; one of the latest models in common use employs a
125 As we emphasize throughout, model outputs involve a certain degree of randomness. Repeated experimen-
tation, ideally with different prompts, is advisable. See infra section III.A. for discussion of best practices.
126 Synthetic data is growing in importance, and sometimes may improve model quality. John Jumper et al.,
Highly accurate Protein Structure Prediction With AlphaFold, NATURE 583, 587–89 (2021) (noting how
training the data using synthetic data improved the model’s accuracy significantly).
127 This, in a sense, is what standard English dictionaries do, at least if one were to number the words by order
of appearance.

vector with 12,288 number-pairs.130 For simplicity of exposition, suppose you had a list of
common animals and had a two-dimensional vector to describe them. One dimension could
be number of feet; another could be if they lived on land or sea. This would produce vectors
that we can visualize below:131
Figure 2: An illustration of the value of encoding meaning via simple embeddings
What makes vectors so powerful is that they allow us to capture not only semantics,
but also a syntactic relationship to other words. Horses and cows, in our very simplistic
schema, are closer to each other than they are to whales or sea turtles. The snake, always
awkward, occupies its own category. If we were to add salamanders, we would spot the emer-
gence of a distinct category of amphibians, alongside the land mammals. Now, suppose you
did the same with over 10,000 dimensions.132 You can imagine the insights that might result
when words are described along such complex dimensions.

continuous representation of feet, where flippers are closer to feet than they are to, say, tails.

mantic categories such as ‘feet’ or ‘habitat’. Rather, they condense information about words in ways that are
useful to the attainment of the model’s training objectives. For the best work to date on deciphering the inner

Making words dimensional has proved powerful in many machine learning tasks,
but was insufficient to power the new LLM revolution. What was needed was the idea of
attention.133 Read the following sentences:
“Shohei Ohtani felt the stress. In a desperate attempt, he swung the bat.”
You intuitively grasp that they mean that Ohtani lifted a wooden bat and used it to
swing at the baseball. But how do you know that this was right, and not that Ohtani had
swung a mammal? As Amelia Bedelia taught us, it’s possible to turn many normal phrases
into misadventures if you ignore context. We know that swung typically is associated with
objects, not animals. And we connect bat with Ohtani, a baseball player, which further so-
lidifies our interpretation of the sentence as referring to the object. In other words, our
minds naturally pay attention to the context of the word to infer the meaning of any specific
word.
An LLM’s attention mechanism seek to achieve the same thing with respect to vec-
tors.134 The model assigns an initial vector to each word in a sentence, which is then enriched
by information about its position in the sentence (via positional encoding). Then the atten-
tion mechanism assesses which words—say bat or swung—shed light on its meaning.135 In
the sentence above, words like “stress” and “felt” are not particularly relevant to the meaning
of the word “bat”; but both “swung” and “Shohei Ohtani” matter. This allows the model to
assign an attention score to each word in the input (relative to the word under analysis) and
then reweigh the encoding of the word under analysis relative to the words that are relevant
to its interpretation. This means that words do not have stable embedding (as in the older
models), but rather, the embedding changes based on the specific context in which they are
presented.

135 This is a simplification in several ways. While we discuss words in the text, current models work at the level
of a token, which is a part of a word. The model is not directed towards meaning per se, but rather towards
information about other tokens that would help it achieve its training objective. Depending on the architec-
ture, attention may be directed only at preceding tokens. There is more than a single attention mechanism and
each one attends to different relationships. There are other subtle simplifications that help the general reader.

GENERATIVE INTERPRETATION
These ideas are combined to train a model. A model refers to a collection of param-
eters (mostly ones called “weights” and “biases”) organized in a specific way whose values are
used to transform the input into the model’s output. Modern language models contain tens
to hundreds of billions of such parameters, hence their common designation as “Large Lan-
guage Models.”
Language models are trained with some objective function, a task which they try to
achieve and on which they are evaluated. In the context of most LLMs, the goal is prediction.
The model is presented with the sentence “Shohei Ohtani felt the stress. In a desperate at-
tempt he swung the [?]” and then the model predicts which word would come next. If the
model were not calibrated, it might have guessed lamp or materiality. As these are (probably)
incorrect, the model is then led to calibrate toward accuracy through a process called gradi-
ent descent.136 This process repeats itself until the model learns that bat follows with 70.14%
probability, base with 25.13%, axe with 0.53%, club with 0.51%, and so on.137
We say the model “learns.” But what does that mean? The simple answer is that
during training, the model adjusts the numerical values of billions of parameters such that
they would produce predictions that are more likely to achieve its training objectives. It con-
ducts various (fairly simple) algebraic operations to create from a sentence like “Hello, how
are you __” a prediction that the next highest probability word would be “doing.” And yet
this simplicity doesn’t capture the process: these parameters are effectively encoded in large,
inscrutable matrices whose meaning is wickedly hard to decipher, and whose organization is
alien. LLMs do not explain the why of their predictions.
You may have read, but would be wrong to conclude, that because the goal is to as-
sign probability to the next word, these models simply imitate text they have seen elsewhere
or only develop a superficial model of the world. To effectively predict the next token in a

and North has a steep slope. You head North, and then after a few steps, you test again, to see which direc-
tion to take now. This process of finding your way is similar to gradient descent. The model identifies the
steepest slope (or gradient) for reducing its deviation from its targets, and adjust its parameters accordingly. It
then checks again with more data, iteratively improving until it finds the best or "lowest" configuration." For

sequence, the models cannot simply memorize what they have seen elsewhere.138 To predict
the continuation of a new sentence like “When they moved to the USA, they set their first
home in the state of ______” would require the model to develop a mathematical sense of
what are states and immigrants, and which ones are popular destinations for those who re-
cently arrived.139 As large as they are, the models are much smaller than the data they are
trained on. And so, models necessarily seek deeper representation of the information they
train on. This is not unlike how humans read books, learn from them, but cannot recite
them. You can see that model outputs are original because they produce entirely new but
responsive text. Of course, this sometimes results sometimes in making up facts.
Finally, consumer-facing chatbots simply invite the user to chat with the model di-
rectly. Behind the scenes, however, the model’s behavior is calibrated by settings called “hy-
perparameters.”140 The details are quite technical, but one of those hyperparameters is of
specific interest. LLMs have “temperature” settings that can be adjusted from low to high.
The lower the model’s temperature, the more predictable its output.141 A very low tempera-
ture ensures that the model always outputs the same answer to the same query. A higher one
introduces more randomness and outputs that you might think of as “creative.”
So far, so good. Now let’s return to our question: What is the model doing when it
assigns a 90% probability to the likelihood that a reasonable person would expect an insur-
ance payment under certain circumstances? The first step for the model is to convert the
query we entered to numbers (really, tensors). The next step is crucial: Now the model at-
tends to the context of words and uses it to adjust their meaning. If the model sees the word
“premium” in the current context, it will know to adjust its meaning away from dictionary
meanings such as “high quality” and towards “consideration for an insurance policy.”142
Armed with a contextual understanding of the query, the model can now run
through its vast internal network of parameters and calculate what is the most likely word

that define its training and operation. We reference here the post-training hyperparamters, noting that there
are also hyperparameters that dictate the training of the model.

(really, token) that would follow next. It will assign infinitesimally low probabilities to words
that relate to gardening or makeup, but will assign increasingly higher probabilities to words
that relate to the insurance context. Once the model determines the most likely continuing
words, it orders them by relevancy. In a zero temperature settings, the model will always
select the word with the highest probability to follow, but as we increase the temperature it
will occasionally pick other words as well. When the model chooses 90%, it is predicting that
this number is the most likely continuation of the text preceding it.
This explanation skips over the hardest question, which is why the model assigns the
highest probability to 90%. The honest answer is quite unsatisfactory: It picked this number
because based on its vast training data and internal statistical model, it found that 90% is a
more likely continuation than 10%. This is nothing like an explanation a human would give,
where reasons and factual considerations would be provided. The model’s outputs are a
brute statistical fact. It is possible to ask the model to justify itself. And the model will dili-
gently reply with an answer. But it is critical to understand that whatever the model tells
you, it is really no explanation at all. It is a prediction of what explanation is likely to follow
the query. So, working with LLMs admittedly requires a leap of faith, a realization that no
better explanation is forthcoming than long inscrutable matrices that produce predictions.
B. LLMs as a Source of Contractual Meaning
With a grasp of the technology in hand, let’s work through some more quotidian
examples of LLMs’ potential use outside of the insurance context. Textualists—as we’ve de-
scribed—think that texts have an inherent plain meaning, at least within the context of the
written document. The problem is deciding what it is, and whether our intuitions are rep-
resentative. LLMs may serve as powerful tools to uncover those answers.
We’ll start with the divorce of Jennie and Mark Famiglio. Jennie and Mark entered
into a prenup before getting married, which committed to a sliding scale of payments from
Mark to Jennie if they divorced, tied to the length of their union. Section 5.3a read:
5.3. JENNIE's Benefits and Obligations. If the marriage ends by dissolution
of marriage or an action for dissolution of marriage is pending at the time of
MARK's death, then JENNIE shall receive the additional benefits and obli-
gations described in 5.3.a. through d.
a. MARK shall pay to JENNIE, within ninety (90) days of the date

listed below next to the number of full years they have been mar-
ried at the time a Petition for Dissolution of Marriage is filed.143
Although Jennie filed a petition for divorce after seven years, she never served the
petition and later voluntarily dismissed the action. After ten years, she filed again, and meant
it. Under the prenup, seven years of marriage entitled her to $2.7 million; ten years a whop-
ping $4.2 million. The parties were left with a consequential but basic interpretative ques-
tion: When the prenup mentions the number of years at the time “a” petition is filed—did
the parties mean the first petition or the ultimate one?
Neither party thought witnesses were necessary, as both understood a Petition to be
unambiguous (and favoring their side). Unfortunately for Jennie, a Florida appellate court
ruled against her.144 Relying in part on dictionaries, it emphasized that “a” is an indefinite
article. Ordinarily, the court stated, when people predicate a condition on an indefinite
event, they mean its first occurrence. Thus, imagine if a golf course posts a rule: “when a
thunderstorm approaches, you must end your golf game.”145 That would be “universally un-
derstood . . . to mean the first time a thunderstorm approaches.” And so, “a” petition filing
simply must mean the first one filed. The court’s method of proof seems sensible. But was it
right to be so sure of itself?
We presented GPT with the prenuptial agreement and asked it: If one of the parties
files a divorce petition, withdraws it, and then a few years later a new petition is filed, what
date determines the number of full years of marriage: the first filing or the second one? It
produced a sentence that essentially supported Jennie’s view. But to illustrate how the model
can help courts be more precise, we can freeze the output in time and take a peek under the
hood, as Figure 3 illustrates.

Figure 3: Davinci-003, temp=1, top-p=1, frequency and repetition penalty =0, best
of 1, full spectrum, presented with Famiglio facts and asked “If one of the parties files a di-
vorce petition, withdraws it, and then a few years later a new petition is filed, what date de-
termines the number of full years of marriage: the first filing or the second one?”
This illustration captures the probabilistic way the model thinks of language and its
own process. When it started to produce its answer, it predicted that it ought to start with
“The.” Now, neither we nor the model know how it would continue the sentence. It read
our question and its partial answer and then made a prediction. Given the context and the
vast corpus on which it sits, what should have come next—second or first? It concluded that
“second” makes more sense. And once second is produced, the rest of the answer follows.146
Generative interpretation in this simple case thus offers courts a better sense of the
relevant probabilities if the parties were intending to use English in its most public and com-
mon sense. And it does so without reference to singular, perhaps idiosyncratic, illustrations
pulled from the golf course. Of course, it’s possible that in the context of their deal, extrinsic
evidence pointed to a private meaning—or perhaps trade practice could have pushed the
court away from the meaning that the model suggests is normal. And, as we’ll discuss, know-
ing that the court would use the model might have motivated both parties to not so quickly
assume that their meaning was unambiguously correct.
C. The Ambiguity Problem
As Famiglio illustrated, the question of whether a term is ambiguous, permitting
extrinsic evidence or not, can be outcome determinative. That’s true for interpretative meth-
ods of all stripes. Even the most free-spirited contextualists are not that free. They will not

example, continue the sentence with “The first filing would not control.”

waste the parties’ time on a lengthy trial when they think that the language in the contract
is simply not “reasonably susceptible” to the interpretation proffered by one of the parties.
As a result, a key question in contextualist jurisdictions is which interpretation, exactly, the
language is reasonably susceptible to.
Take the well-known case of Trident v. Connecticut, often listed as a primary argu-
ment against California-style contextualism.147 A group of lawyers, assisted by other real es-
tate investors, sought to buy commercial real estate to build their law offices. They borrowed
$56 million from Connecticut Insurance, with an agreement to pay it back over 15 years at
12.25% APR. At one point, the agreement stated that the principal could not be prepaid, at
least not within the first 12 years of the agreement. However, interest rates fell, and the bor-
rowers sought to prepay the loan with money they would borrow elsewhere.148 When they
were rebuked, they turned to litigation.
The promissory note clearly stated that the borrowers “shall not have the right to
prepay the principal amount hereof in whole or in part.” But they pointed to a different
clause, creating a 10% prepayment penalty for defaulted loans if the lender accelerated.149
The borrowers’ lawyers relied on the famous statement of California’s contextualism rule,
Pacific Gas,150 to argue that they ought to be permitted to offer extrinsic evidence—negoti-
ations, trade usage—in support of their contractual reading.151
In the Ninth Circuit, Judge Kozinski used the case to offer what others have de-
scribed as a “shrill attack” on the looseness of the California parol evidence rule.152 He dis-
counted the borrower’s prepayment argument, since it was at the lender’s option. And he
concluded that the contract’s “shall not have the right” clause was crystal clear that prepay-
ment was forbidden—standing alone, it was not reasonably susceptible to the borrower’s
meaning. Nonetheless, Judge Kozinski remanded the case. He wrote:
Under Pacific Gas, it matters not how clearly a contract is written, nor how
completely it is integrated, nor how carefully it is negotiated, nor how
squarely it addresses the issue before the court: the contract cannot be ren-
dered impervious to attack by parol evidence. If one side is willing to claim

that the parties intended one thing but the agreement provides for another,
the court must consider extrinsic evidence of possible ambiguity. If that ev-
idence raises the specter of ambiguity where there was none before, the con-
tract language is displaced and the intention of the parties must be divined
from self-serving testimony offered by partisan witnesses whose recollection
is hazy from passage of time and colored by their conflicting interests . . .
The opinion, written with flair, is in many contracts casebooks, but it is a puzzle in
its own right. California’s existing rule provided that extrinsic evidence was to be admitted
only if the language in the contract was “reasonably susceptible” to the interpretation prof-
fered by the parties. Thus, if Kozinski really had been confident that the language was clear,
he should not have remanded.153 We wondered whether his factual premise was correct and
asked LLMs to help.
After obtaining the original promissory note,154 we introduced the relevant parts to
three leading LLMs: GPT-4, Claude 2, and a version of the open source model Llama -2,
and then asked for their evaluation.155 We asked them to read the entire contract and then
estimate, as a judge, the likelihood that the parties intended early repayment to be permitted
under the agreement. To capture a range of model responses, we repeated the same question
many times, while setting the “temperature” at a sufficiently high level to ensure that differ-
ent responses might be picked.

Figure 4: Turbo GPT-4, Claude 2, and Llama-2 70b with set at temperature 1, and
fed with the Trident promissory note in full. The models asked whether the language of the
agreement is reasonably susceptible of being read as providing the borrower the right to early
repayment. On the x-axis, 0 indicates this interpretation is wrong and 100 is that it is correct.
Figure 4 is suggestive of how generative interpretation can deepen and enrich judi-
cial analysis. Overall, the models roughly agree on average that prepayment is not allowed,
with a mean score of ~41. The least powerful model here, Llama 2, was more open to the
possibility than the more powerful, proprietary models. But the two most powerful models,
Claude 2 and GPT-4, both shared a similar evaluation: the contract was not “reasonably
susceptible” to the interpretation advanced by the Trident group.
One read of this result is that it suggests that Kozinski’s intuitive factual premise
was wrong, but that he reached the right conclusion. That is, even taking the borrower’s
argument seriously, the dominant reading rejects a finding of ambiguity. No further extrin-
sic evidence ought to have been admitted. This would align with common criticisms of the
opinion.156 On the other hand, the models were not uniform in their assessment; the prob-
ability distribution suggests that at least some probabilistic readings of the contract permit

early repayment. To determine the case, we would want to know more about those minori-
tarian readings: Are they reflective of discrete linguistic communities, private meanings, or
other legally relevant factors? Generative interpretation does not answer the question of
whether language is reasonably susceptible of a meaning, it instead helps us visualize a broad
spectrum of meaning and quantify how likely a particular result is.157
Now consider another case turning on ambiguity: Ellington v. EMI.158 The issue in
this case arose from a 1961 net receipts agreement between the musician Edward Kennedy
“Duke” Ellington and his record company, EMI. As was common at the time, the parties
agreed on a 50/50 royalty split, after deducting fees charged by third parties that intermedi-
ate in foreign markets. This net receipt agreement bound EMI and its “other affiliates.” In
the intervening decades, the music industry underwent significant consolidation, and EMI
began to use its own affiliates rather than rely on third parties for foreign operations. It
sought to deduct those affiliate fees before paying Ellington’s estate.
Feeling blue, Ellington’s grandson sued, arguing that two key phrases in the contract
were ambiguous: “(1) the phrase “net revenue actually received” in the royalty provision and
(2) the term “any other affiliate” in the definition of Second Party.”159 The New York Court
of Appeals––the country’s preeminent textualist tribunal—rejected the claim. The majority
held that the terms were unambiguous: They only reference affiliates that existed at the time
of contracting. There is simply no way that they could be read in any other way, given the
tense that the parties used and the court’s aversion to forward-looking language.160
Again we had access to the original contract. We presented it to the various models
for plain language analysis, asking: “Does ‘other affiliates’ naturally include only the existing
affiliates at the time of contract, or does it potentially encompass affiliates that might be
created over time?”
157 Whether a conclusion that is 20% likely is legally reasonable might turn on several factors we do not explore
in the text. Imagine a particular linguistic subcommunity whose understanding of terms correlates with the
parties’. (You could think of this as akin to trade usage, but for culture.) In that case, deferring to majoritarian
readings would tend to suppress important perspectives. See generally Dan Kahan, David A. Hoffman and

Before we describe the model’s answer, we should highlight two robustness concerns
with model interpretation. Models are quite sensitive to the prompt used.161 This opens
them to a problem of “leading prompts,” queries that lead the model towards a desired an-
swer. And, as we described earlier, models can be set to be hotter (more random) or colder
(more deterministic). This allows the user (judge, researcher, policymaker) many degrees of
freedom.
To deal with these issues we tried something new. Rather than a single prompt, we
used 20 variations of the same question, each queried 10 times at a relatively high tempera-
ture setting.162 We presented yes/no questions where yes indicates agreement with the
judge’s interpretation. The Figure below summarizes the results of the experiment among
four of the leading models.

yond the Few-Shot Paradigm, arXiv:2102.07350 (2022) (discussing the effect of prompting tech-
niques on model outputs).

As the Figure illustrates, the four models don’t share the New York court’s confi-
dence: The most common interpretation of “other affiliates” includes those that post-date
the contract. Llama-2, the open source model, is somewhat open to EMI argument, reflect-
ing that it has some facial plausibility. Of course, even uniformity between powerful models
cannot decide cases. The point, rather, it to illustrate the value of LLMs as a convenient
check against overconfidence, and a spur to greater reflection. (Though the fact that the dis-
sent thought that the contract was ambiguous might have produced that same introspec-
tion.)
D. Filling Gaps
One of the most difficult issues in contract interpretation is distinguishing silence
from unexpected gaps. Contracts are incomplete: The parties leave many topics to necessary

implication. Such omissions are not always deliberate: Sometimes parties simply have not
contemplated a problem—a global pandemic, a supply chain disruption, another peerless
ship sailing ex Bombay163—and the court must engage in filling the gaps, rather than merely
interpreting words on the page. Whether a court is “filling a gap” by extrapolating from the
parties’ words and actions, or “constructing” a contract term by its own lights, is a highly
contested problem.164 But antecedent to that dispute is a simpler one: can we do a better job
of predicting what the parties would’ve said had they been asked at contracting about an area
they left blank?
Consider the 1977 New York Court of Appeals case, Haines v. City of New York.
It resolves a dispute about a 1924 contract between the City of New York and an upstate
village, in which the City promised to pay the town to process its own sewage so that the
city’s water supply could be cleaned. (That is, the city paid the village not to pollute.) As the
decades passed, the townships grew and the Federal Government passed environmental reg-
ulations. By the early 1970s, facing strong budgetary pressures, New York City refused to
continue to pay for the township’s expansion of the sewage facilities. A local developer sued,
arguing that the contract’s absence of a duration term or cabin on the scope of the city’s
obligation meant that the city was in breach.
The court considered those arguments in a decision that looked only to the written
contract. It determined that the parties did not mean for the contract to run forever, in a
provision notable for its brevity.
[W]here the parties have not clearly expressed the duration of a contract,
the courts will imply that they intended performance to continue for a rea-
sonable time but also did not mean it to be terminable at will . . . .Thus, we
hold that it is reasonable to infer from the circumstances of the 1924 agree-
ment that the parties intended the city to maintain the sewage disposal fa-
cility until such time as the city no longer needed or desired the water, the
purity of which the plant was designed to insure.165
The logic here isn’t compelling but rests on a empirical prior: By default, parties do
not intend contracts to be terminable at will when they write unlimited obligations, and
nothing about the language or circumstances of the contract compels a contrary conclusion.

GENERATIVE INTERPRETATION
On the related question of whether the city promised (implicitly) to continue to
expand the system’s capacity, the court was less generous.
By the agreement, the city obligated itself to build a specifically described disposal
facility and to extend the lines of that facility to meet future increased demand. At
the present time, the extension of those lines would result in the overloading of the
system. Plaintiff claims that the city is required to build a new plant or expand the
existing facility to overcome the problem. We disagree. The city should not be re-
quired to extend the lines to plaintiffs' property if to do so would overload the sys-
tem and result in its inability to properly treat sewage. In providing for the extension
of sewer lines, the contract does not obligate the city to provide sewage disposal ser-
vices for properties in areas of the municipalities not presently served or even to new
properties in areas which are presently served where to do so could reasonably be
expected to significantly increase the demand on present plant facilities.166
Once more the court alludes to the agreement, but its decision is inattentive to the
details. It found an implicit condition to obligation: Extension is required only so long as
the system is not overloaded.167 But this was a gap-filling exercise, informed by the court’s
judgment about what the parties should have said.168 Such determinations were part of a
trend in New York courts’ in favor of a looser, Cardozian approach to missing terms.169
With the cooperation of the New York court system, we obtained the 1924 con-
tract.170 This contract and the various exhibits are long, especially considering when they
were created: about eight pages of Word documents. We entered the text into the two mod-
els that can support such long inputs—GPT-4's experimental version and Claude 2—and

for most contracts.172 GPT-4 (like the court) explained, “while a reasonable duration might
be inferred under common law principles, this argument does not strongly accord with the
contract’s language.”173 Overall, the models appear to generally support the court’s reading.
The second set of questions involved the scope of the city’s obligations. GPT-4 dis-
agreed strongly with the court; it thought that the city’s obligation was unbounded. Im-
portantly, it anchored its reasoning in a section of the contract neglected by the court: Sec-
tion 6. That part obligates the city to extend sewage plans “[w]henever extensions of any of
the sewer lines are necessitated by future growth . . . of the respective communities.” For
ChatGPT-4, this provision implied the obligation to build additional treatment plants. But
Claude 2 was more amenable to the court’s interpretation and provided a plausible con-
straining argument: “The agreement provides for extensions when required by growth, im-
plying a reasonable obligation.”
E. From Text to Context
So far, we have provided examples that showcase how large language models might
power a stronger, cheaper, more robust form of textualism. We now consider how such mod-
els can account for contextual evidence such as prior conversations, shared expectations, and
industry standards. Stewart v. Newbury provides a simple illustration.174 In Stewart, a con-
tractor and a business corresponded about the construction of a new foundry. The contrac-
tor’s offer letter was brief; he offered to do the job and charge either by offering an itemized
list or by charging on a cost + 10% basis. This letter was followed by a telephone call where
they may have agreed that payment would be made “in the usual manner.” Finally, the
foundry responded in writing that, following the phone conversation, they accepted the bid.
As far as we know, that amounts to the entirety of the contracting case file.175
Once the contractor finished the first part of the project, he submitted a bill. The
foundry refused to pay. The contractor insisted that it was customary to pay 85% of pay-
ments due at the end of every month, but the foundry argued that its payments were only
due on (substantial) completion of the project. Seeing no payments made, the contractor
stopped work. The parties countersued for breach.
172 See Glacial Plains Coop. v. Chippewa Valley Ethanol Co., LLLP, 912 N.W.2d 233, 234 (Minn. 2018)
(holding that unless otherwise provided, a “contract is of indefinite duration and is terminable at will by ei-
ther party after a reasonable time and with reasonable notice.”)
173 Likewise Claude-2 explained: “A reasonable duration could be implied, though not explicitly stated.”

Today, the default rule is that payments in construction contracts are not due until
the contract is substantially performed.176 It is unclear that this rule was in place when the
parties agreed in 1919. The foundry argued that no payment was due under the contract,
and hence, the contractor’s refusal to work was wrongful. So now we have an interpretive
question: Did the parties agree to a particular payment regime?
The written agreement is too sparse to help, but the phone conversation offers an
in. If we believe that the parties indeed agreed to make payments in the usual manner, then
it is possible to interpret usual as referring to an alleged common practice of monthly install-
ment payments. It is also possible, however, that ‘usual’ refers to other standard payment
conventions—say, the payment on a cost +10% basis.
The court remanded because of faulty jury instructions, so the interpretative ques-
tion was left undecided. We, however, are not so constricted. We asked today’s leading
LLMs, GPT-4 and Claude-4, to predict what the parties meant. To do so, we first told the
models to assume that the default legal rule would be that payment is conditioned on sub-
stantial performance.177 Then, we asked the models to estimate how the parties would have
interpreted their deal absent consideration of either extrinsic evidence of the phone conver-
sation or evidence of industry norms. We then added the evidence of the phone conversa-
tion, to see how the model’s confidence changed, and finally, we added evidence of the cus-
tom in the industry. Table 1 summarizes the results:178
176 See 22 N.Y. JUR. 2D CONTRACTS § 352; Hillman, supra note 168, at 313 (“courts in construction cases find
a duty to pay only after substantial performance”).
177 This is not obviously the correct legal rule, then or now, but we had to start somewhere, and we took the
court at its word.
178 CLAUDE 2.0 POE CONSERVATION, https://poe.com/s/wLkeCDrPdFpKye3uApSa (last visited July 30,

piece of evidence, not its quantification, is reliable.

GENERATIVE INTERPRETATION
Table 2: Expressed confidence in “the duty to pay is monthly” based on legal and
transactional context. Presented to GPT-4 (32k context window) and Claude-2 (100k
context window).
Table 2 demonstrates how each additional piece of evidence alters the analysis. And
for purposes of this case, it shows that, for the models at least, extrinsic evidence was mate-
rially important to the outcome.
Illustrating the additional value of each piece of evidence can provided unexpected
value. Judges may fairly worry, when considering potentially unreliable evidence, that mere
exposure to the evidence would irreversibly prejudice their decisions. By estimating the pro-
bative value of some forms of evidence before closely examining them, the judge can develop
a heuristic assessment of probative value with relatively little exposure. The model can thus
give structure to the evaluation of extrinsic evidence, making it more attractive to factfind-
ers. And within the limits of its prompts, its conclusions are coherent, cheap, and seemingly
plausible.
III. THE FUTURE OF CONTRACT INTERPRETATION
So convenient are today’s LLMs, and so seductive are their outputs, that it would be
genuinely surprising if judges were not using them to resolve questions of contract interpre-
tation as we write this article, only a few months after the tools went mainstream. Looking
at practical guidance offered to lawyers in the summer of 2023, we see lawyers are encour-
aged to use LLMs to perform legal research, draft deposition questions and contracts, and
predict settlement values.179 And there are hints that judges are already using ChatGPT to
answer other kinds of interpretative questions, just as they would use Google.180 In one re-
cent survey, one-quarter of judges confessed to using the tool, though many expressed con-
cern about its reliability.181
These models are useful because they offer new tools—fast, cheap, sometimes incor-
rect ones—in service of old interpretative goals. Courts will soon take a phrase like “dozen”

and ask ChatGPT to interpret it, rather than turning to the dictionary or Google; or will
ask the model what’s the likely assumption a contract makes when it leaves a gap; or will
check if the model thinks an insurance policy contemplated deft burglars. They’ll do so both
covertly and overtly, both sua sponte and in response to briefing. Almost certainly the first
briefs to affirmatively argue for the use of the tool will come from resource-constrained
firms. As we illustrated in Part II of this Article, LLMs are already applicable to live problems
that courts face every day, and it would be naïve to think they aren’t using them.
Indeed, we’ve seen this story play out many times before. As some readers will recall,
when courts first realized that Wikipedia could be used as a source of information,182 they
were chastised for its use by higher courts,183 and then it was eventually folded into the nor-
mal set of legal research tools.184 But at least in the short run, judges won’t have the tool draft
opinions. And why would they? That courts are irreducibly part of the interpretative enter-
prise—no matter how sophisticated prediction machines get—follows from the obvious
point that there are two stages to every contract interpretation problem: figuring out what
the parties meant (at contracting), and deciding the “legal significance that should attach to
the semantic content.”185 The LLM method is simply better for many reference purposes
than those currently on offer.
The problem then is not whether courts will use LLMs as an aid to interpretation,
but how. Generative interpretation is a tool and as such, it has strengths, limits, and flaws.
To be sure, AI’s most enthusiastic wielders will be its least careful adopters. Thus, our goal
in Section III.A is to delimit some principles and limitations for LLM usage by lawyers and
judges. With the proper usage of the tool in mind, in Section III.B we suggest that generative
interpretation has implications for the continuing vitality of longstanding debates between
textualism and contextualism. Or to put it differently, while the uses that we suggest in Sec-
tion III.A could be thought of as Textualism 2.0—better dictionaries and canons—we don’t
think that’s the practical limit of what this method of interpretation can do.

GENERATIVE INTERPRETATION
A. Interpretation for the 99%?
As we’ve said, in the coming months and years, we’re sure you will read examples of
lawyers and judges using ChatGPT and related tools in perverse, sometimes outright silly
ways, and reaching absurd results you think would have been avoided had they just buckled
down and done their jobs like careful jurists ought to. Or, worse, they’ll have these tools
generate pedestrian prose that looks like soulless briefing or opinion-writing, but in fact is
built on a throne of lies. There’s no question that AI will sometimes be a crutch for lazy or
harried lawyers who simply didn’t focus on the details: It might not be ideally pitched at the
kinds of people who are reading sentences with care 20,000 words into a law review article.
And yet it’s precisely because LLMs are cheap and workmanlike that they will be of
real use in contract interpretation. The biggest single problem with all currently available
approaches to contract interpretation isn’t that they are incapable of getting correct results
some of the time. It’s that they are inaccessible to ordinary parties.186 Non-wealthy individ-
uals who suffer breach have to lump it,187 tilt against corporations in internal dispute reso-
lution systems,188 or face financially ruinous fees and prevail in pyrrhic victories.189 Simply
put: There is an access-to-justice problem at the center of contract law as pernicious as the
better recognized ones in criminal and constitutional adjudication. The costs and uncertain-
ties of interpretating deals, which form the core of contract litigation, materially contribute
to this problem.190

Costly interpretation burdens judges too. Chambers are not endowed with refer-
ence experts on call for every query. Courts have fewer resources and competencies than the
layperson would imagine. This stylized fact alone can explain why dictionaries are popular,
and why corpus linguistics is at best experimental; why law office history exists but not law
office econometrics; and perhaps even why federal precedent on state issues is more cited
than the relevant state law, given that the former is thoroughly indexed in common com-
mercial databases and the latter is not.191 To substitute for dictionaries and familiar Latin
canons, new interpretative tools must be free (or nearly so) and widely available. LLMs sat-
isfy those conditions. Already today, interactions through a chat interface do not require
more skill than using a search engine. The deft burglar example offers a proof of concept,
and the remaining examples (though not immediately available in your chatbot window) are
likely months, not years, away.
Generative interpretation is a tool which responds to this access-to-justice concern,
at several levels.
First, if courts commit to the method, the costs of achieving accuracy in contract
interpretation disputes will fall.192 That’s so because the less precise, even if relatively cheap,
forms of textualist evidence—dictionaries and canons—will be replaced by better ones. As
dispute costs fall and outcomes become more predictable, the returns to opportunistic
breach, which generally benefits sophisticated players, will fall.193 It’s true that models may
arise to compete in the market, but as we’ve shown above, more sophisticated models tend
to converge on meaning:: unlike dictionaries, they are not offering idiosyncratic and curated
definitions which differ across people, place and time.
Second, as outcomes become more certain, and the cost of predicting them falls,
there will be fewer cases to adjudicate, because parties will likely have a much better sense of
what they’ll get at verdict, and settle accordingly.194 LLMs, unlike legal dictionaries, require
no specialized legal knowledge to access, and their ease of use will likely improve with time.

600 (2020) (documenting the “dominance of the federal forum”).

194 Cf. Schwartz & Scott, supra note 38, at 603 (“When a standard governs, the party who wants to behave
strategically must ask what a court will later do if the party is sued. The vaguer the legal standard and the more
that is at stake, the more likely the party is to resolve doubts in its own favor.”). This is a partial equilibrium
analysis—better adjudication processes invite more commercial activity, which in turn increases contracting.

GENERATIVE INTERPRETATION
This implies that there will be a levelling of access to information about law, and a redistri-
bution from more to less repeat players. Further, better calibrated results ex post means that
parties can spend less time (and money) contracting ex ante.195 A promise of generative in-
terpretation—which it may yet fulfill—is that it will open a form of textualism up to the
99%.196
The pages of law reviews are littered with proposed technological solutions to sup-
posed problems of excessive legal costs, and unequal access to information about legal out-
comes, which turn out to be either more intractable than the authors thought or ignore vir-
tues that the authors discounted. We should proceed with care, especially when recom-
mending the widespread adoption of a chatbot that sits on matrices whose outputs even its
creators do not well-understand. The question is not (in our view) whether generative in-
terpretation offers predictions that are superior in all cases to artisanal, careful, linguistic
analysis. It’s whether the method is good enough, right now or soon, for resource-deprived
courts to adopt in ordinary cases. In evaluating that question of basic competency, it’s mean-
ingful that even today’s unspecialized models can replicate the results of well-considered
cases (as Part II explored) and prompt courts to consider their own priors.
But Part II offered a curated tour of generative interpretation’s greatest hits. It didn’t
show you where things can go wrong. To make this tool perform as well as it can, users
should be cognizant of these issues and use it according to evolving best practices. To begin,
let’s start with hallucinatory outputs.197 In a now-famous case from May 2023, lawyers in a
New York Federal court turned to ChatGPT for help researching a motion. The tool
obliged with helpful cites, but unfortunately had completely made up the opinions in ques-

judges have required lawyers to certify that they had not used any form of Artificial Intelli-
gence in their filings.200
False outputs arise from the predictive nature of generative models.201 Hallucina-
tions are generated texts asserting facts that are not quite true.202 Large language models,
remember, are statistical tools optimized to make predictions. But LLMs are not like a help-
ful librarian that simply pulls out the most relevant book on a topic. Facts are stored in the
LLM similar to the way other reasoning and statistical facts are stored, as floating points in
a labyrinthian array of vectors. When asked to provide a source on a legal matter, the model
employs the same method to elicit both facts and inferences. The output doesn’t distinguish
facts from inferred facts, and sometimes will predict the world incorrectly.
Recent work has made significant advances in understanding and mitigating hallu-
cination errors, and more powerful models are less susceptible.203 One solution that is al-
ready used in some contexts is connecting the model to a database of facts, so that it can act

more like the helpful librarian.204 Another involves reflective self-evaluation.205 So while it is
appropriate to pay attention to the hallucination problem, we tend to think that this prob-
lem will be less salient in the future than it is today. That said, as a best practice, judges would
do well to cross-verify the answers that they get from one platform against another, just as
in the early days of legal research it would pay to check both Lexis and Westlaw to make sure
that your research was complete.206
Second, models are subject to manipulation. Large language models are malleable;
“leading prompts” can lead them to different conclusions. This is roughly analogous to lead-
ing questions for witnesses or jury instructions that frame disputes for or against a particular
outcome. As anyone who has experience with an LLM chat bot will attest, it is relatively easy
to drive conversations toward desired outcomes. In litigation practice, we should expect that
the parties themselves will submit competing prompts, just as they vie to control the framing
of the legal questions in litigation today. In response, factfinders can (as we illustrated above)
ask the model to itself produce competing prompts, and then, rather than relying on a single
query, the factfinder can look at the general trend of responses and share those varying out-
comes in their decisions. Factfinders will also have to decide whether to defer to the parties’
choice of model, should they make that explicit in their contract.
The Katrina analysis raises the related problem of model interpretability.207 The way
models encode language is not based in semantics. Unlike human-based reasoning, models
have a precise sense in which “chocolate” is closer to “bread” than to “nutrition”. This pre-
cision can be misleading if interpreted naively. The Katrina example illustrates how dis-
tances correspond with a sensible account of meaning. It also shows that the policy excep-
tions were closer to ‘fire’ than to the arbitrarily chosen word ‘police.’ It is difficult to under-
stand why, precisely, this result followed. Possibly, fire is a category of disaster and in this
sense it is closer to the insurance policy. Still, it would be misleading to say that the policy
excludes fire damage rather than damage caused by the police. Other terms may lead to more
counterintuitive results. This interpretability gap should caution care in the direct transla-
tion of model outputs to legal judgments. Yet, it is also the case that, on average, these models

predict with great accuracy linguistic distinctions that humans make. 208 This presents a gen-
eral tension in language models. They are generally extremely good at capturing meaning,
but they still make errors and it is not always possible to rationalize or foresee these errors.
A third consideration focuses on the models’ strength: They are naturally inclined
to make predictions that maximize probability—in other words, they are biased towards
majoritarian interpretations. Models offer an approximation of general understanding that
may simply not be available in any other way, and thus advance long-held goals of contract
theory.209 But majoritarian interpretations are just that: they embed and advance the values
of the majority. This is doubly problematic. First, courts really ought to be attentive to local,
more private, meanings: Public meaning is second best, prioritized because it is efficient and
not because it is correct.210 But more generally, because the linguistic conventions of un-
derrepresented communities are submerged by majoritarian public meanings, they will find
it more difficult to have their voices surfaced (and thus subsidized) in contract adjudication.
Majoritarian interpretative approaches risk silencing entire communities.211
Surely, this is not a problem unique to generative interpretation: dictionaries, can-
ons, and corpora are equally, if not more, vulnerable to the charge.212 And unlike dictionary-
and-canon-textualism, it is at least theoretically possible to counter the majoritarian-bent of
models in several ways. Models trained on curated datasets that reflect the linguistic conven-
tions of distinct communities would bend towards the majoritarian patterns within those
communities. Adjustments to the model’s hyperparameters elicit more-or-less majoritarian
behaviors from the model. And careful prompt engineering can attune the model to specific

sometimes lead courts astray. See generally Stephen J. Choi, Mitu Gulati & Robert E. Scott, The Black Hole

and there, that will be enough to make the model erroneously see a horse or a yield sign.216
The same manipulations can be used to “attack” LLM models.217 Slight changes in the word-
ing of a contract—e.g., subtle changes in the presentation of the words—might hack the
model logic system and alter its interpretation.218 There is no known general solution to such
issues. But if judges and parties become aware of the possibility of such subtle manipulations,
they might develop defenses, like using sanitized versions of the contract in their analyses.219
Fifth, models are sensitive to time. As your neighborhood originalist will tell you,
the meaning of words is embedded in the time they were used. If we want to interpret the
meaning of a contract signed in 1924, we should account for the linguistic conventions of

the time. Models today are trained on data indiscriminately: It is unlikely that they will be
able to interpret a term as it was read in a specific period in time. The problem is com-
pounded since the training data may include information that was not available for the con-
tracting parties at the time of contracting. This may well include the decision of a trial court
when the appellate court seeks to interpret the contract. We can think about this as pollu-
tion of the database: For example, perhaps Hurricane Katrina associated “levee” with “flood”
more closely than it was at the time the relevant insurance contracts were signed.220 Or per-
haps the Stewart example was confounded by the subsequent decades of linguistic evidence
of payment defaults.
This problem is longstanding. Judges’ innate sense of language is also grounded in
the linguistic conventions in which they are personally embedded. Dictionaries and corpus
linguistics have an advantage here, because one could seek a dictionary or a corpus from the
relevant time period. But even this advantage is limited, because dictionaries are updated in
intervals of decades,221 and corpora cover considerably fewer texts when they are sliced to
relevant time periods.222 Thus, courts will have to consider whether the use of language has
shifted over time, and perhaps restrain the use of generative interpretation in cases where its
training data suffers from linguistic drift. Another way to put this is that generative inter-
pretation is likely to be least useful for old contracts, where worries about subsequent judicial
opinions interpreting like terms are most severe, unless and until specialized models with
time delineated training data come online.
Sixth, generative interpretation will need a language of its own. Although scholars
often hype objective, scientific methods of proof and judgment, this way of explaining and
justifying the exercise of power is uncompelling, and perhaps repulsive, to the population at
large.223 (Which is one reason we’ve tried to tamp down the statistics and claims to singular
answers in this paper.) Juries, after all, aren’t presented with simple probabilistic proofs, and
judges don’t typically justify their decisions by saying they have a 51% chance of being
220 A more far-fetched problem is parties trying to inject meaning into the record, just as they would in a normal
interpretation dispute by way of after-action lawyer letters and the like. But because parties expect perfor-
mance, not breach, and the relevant corpora for LLMs is so vast, jurists should worry less about this problem
than the internal-to-the-text adversarial attacks we describe above.

right.224 Thus, a real problem for the method—which it shares with corpus linguistics and
the survey methodologies discussed in Part I—is how to explain itself to lay audiences in
ways that reinforce, rather than diminish, judicial legitimacy.225 It’s sociologically normal to
say that the word chicken takes meaning from the dictionary and trade usage.226 This socio-
logical framework does not yet exist for black box language models.227 Courts will have to
find ways to wrap the results from automated interpretation in packages that help laypeople
to see law as engaging in a values-driven, communal, constrained exercise, and not merely
the highest probability next-token predictions.228
The solution likely lies in a specific type of transparency. Just as much as judges are
sociologically committed to certain types of dictionaries, so will it be the case that certain
models will emerge as robust and trustworthy. The current practice of interpretation is
largely indefensible on this score; because we have no window into the court’s processes, we
cannot see the dictionaries it did not select or the words it chose not to focus on. But we can
know what model a court picks, and from that selection, what probabilities it assessed. We
cannot know exactly how the model produced those outcomes, as this knowledge lies in its
vast inscrutable matrices. But so long as a judge not only discloses the version of the model
that she employed, but also the particular prompts that she used, generative interpretation

is more replicable than any other method on offer.229 (We have tried to show how that would
work in the notes of this article.) Indeed, courts might go further: They can capsule the re-
sults of their inquiries and incorporate them as permanent links to their opinions.
In summary, generative interpretation promises an accessible, relatively predictable,
tool that will help lawyers and judges interpret contracts. If it’s to achieve that promise,
courts will need to be careful to use this tool while being mindful of its uses and limitations.
To guide what would inevitably be a process of exploration, we offered a series of best prac-
tices based on the technical foundations and legal constraints that define the limits of this
tool. As a default, judges should disclose the models and prompts they use and try to validate
their analyses on different models and with multiple inputs. Ideally, they’d capsule their
findings online. They’ll want to be careful about parties’ manipulative behavior, and to con-
sider how (and whether) to excavate private, non-majority meanings. By doing so—and by
saying what they are doing clearly and with appropriate recognition of LLMs’ foibles—
courts can fairly experiment with this new technology and achieve a better grasp on the con-
tract’s meaning, without abusing the tool or subjecting themselves to reversals.
B. Beyond the Textualist/Contextualist Divide
As we described in Part I, the modern debate about interpretation takes as a given
that prediction is the goal. But in dividing about how to best accomplish prediction, scholars
and courts disagree about an empirical meta-question: How would most parties prefer that
courts interpret their deals?230 Many have argued that sophisticated parties prefer textual-
ism.231 Others assert that contextualism is preferred, especially within longer-term relational
contexts.232 Some argue such preferences are, well, contextual.233 Litigated cases appear to be
all over the map.234 The views of poorer parties are more rarely studied. True, contextualism
promises to protect parties from bait-and-switch maneuvers and opportunistic drafting. But
who can afford it?
229 The model disclosure should include the model’s hyperparameters, much like judges share the version of
the dictionary they consulted.

GENERATIVE INTERPRETATION
Generative interpretation challenges the utility of this old binary. Starting with tex-
tualism, its proponents have said that it builds a common commercial vocabulary and moti-
vates clear contract drafting.235 But if applied correctly, generative interpretation (as a form
of textualism) can predict parties’ intent well even without invocation of specialized lan-
guage or expensive drafting. And if courts follow our proposed best practices, this method is
also predictable ex ante. When parties can anticipate in advance the choice of model—and
we argue that they should be able to contract for it explicitly—then they can clarify disputes
well ahead of litigation. Even if the judge consults a broader evidentiary base than the con-
tract itself, models can incorporate it and produce consistent outputs.
By contrast, contextualism promises accuracy by integrating all relevant evidence.
Its champions think it protects the weak from the powerful and reflects the real premises of
relational contracting relationships.236 But as a judicial practice, it encourages gamesman-
ship,237 exposes decisionmakers to bias-inducing testimonies, increases uncertainty,238 and
more than anything, is simply very expensive. Generative interpretation can also serve as a
form of contextualism. It is cheaper to incorporate context into the process when the model
can feed on dozens of pages of evidence. Models are not prejudiced by parcels of evidence
like human decisionmakers. And armed with LLMs, judges can assess, at the summary judg-
ment stage, the incremental probative value of proposed elements of evidence. As we demon-
strated with respect to Stewart, the judge can weigh in advance whether litigation over, say,
the records of a phone conversation would be materially important to the outcome. This
kind of prioritization is generally the approach of Uniform Commercial Code. 239 Courts
might be more comfortable adopting the UCC’s generally contextual approach outside the
law of sales were they to believe that each type of evidence could be (in fact) separately eval-
uated and weighed.

All of this suggests a disruption of the traditional impasse. Generative interpretation
allows both predictability and restraint, while also offering better linguistic accuracy. And it
corrals litigation costs.240 Or to put it differently, the choice between four corners or no cor-
ners at all is a product of its time and of a specific adjudicatory technology. As this technol-
ogy improves, judges can relax old safeguards towards a more inclusive approach.
To be sure, generative interpretation would be a simple flip in the default: Parties
could indicate that their meaning was not to be determined by large language models, just as
they can now commit to avoiding certain dictionaries or choosing others.241 Just as using a
dictionary to interpret a secret cipher is a foolish way to interpret a deal,242 following parties’
expressed interpretative preferences is wise. Generally speaking, giving parties the ability to
control how contracts are interpreted respects their autonomy and carries efficiency bene-
fits.243 So too here: Generative interpretation expands the kinds of evidence that most par-
ties would like courts to consider, but it won’t be for everyone.
Even if all generative interpretation does is flip the default on extrinsic evidence sur-
rounding contracting, it still has important distributive effects. Textualism’s many virtues
can be recast as its elitist faults. Poorer parties, or uncounseled ones, often misunderstand
the relationship between contractual disclaimers of reliance and oral sales talk.244 Though
the Restatement of Consumer Contracts suggests that courts should be more open to the
idea that contracts that disclaim obligation in the face of contrary promises should not be
enforced,245 it does little to help with interpretative disputes which are less obviously unjust.
And yet there are many examples of parties’ proffered meaning being excluded as violative
of the parol evidence rule,246 or simply not considered because the meaning is purportedly
plain.247 As the Ellington example above demonstrates, even on their own terms such deci-
sions may be questioned.248 But if the parties have not otherwise indicated, generative

GENERATIVE INTERPRETATION
interpretation will provide more evidence to courts that extrinsic meaning ought to matter
in discerning what the parties contemporaneously would have said they meant.
An exemplary case that generative interpretation could benefit is Smith v. Cit-
icorp.249 The Smiths needed to borrow money to repay an old loan and pay for some home
improvements. They turned to Citicorp, which purported to create a revolving loan agree-
ment, secured by their home. The key to the dispute was that the interest rate on this loan
was 13.99% APR, a rate only permissible for revolving loans, not closed ones. The Smiths
argued that closed is exactly what the loan agreement was. Miraculously, the Smiths had
signed affidavits from two Citicorp employees, attesting that Citicorp never intended to
make advances on this loan (which would have defined an open-ended, revolving, loan). But
the Supreme Court of Alabama ignored that highly-probative and rare evidence because it
laid outside the four corners of the contract.
We think this result gives too much weight to generalized worries about courts’
competency to evaluate extrinsic evidence. It would be a trivial task to incorporate the affi-
davits into the generative analysis, and, as we’ve shown, they can be weighted according to
the judge’s priors. This would not resolve questions of credibility and relevance, but the flex-
ibility of incorporating it at the margins might radically improve the accuracy of the court’s
analysis.
Because generative interpretation blurs the line between textualism and methods of
interpretation that are more capacious in their evidentiary sources, and because it enables a
new set of evaluative metrics and socio-legal advantages, we think that it ultimately won’t be
(just) Textualism 2.0. Rather, it will become a distinctive method of evaluating contractual
meaning, marked by its own jargon, normative commitments, and practitioner community.
That new methodology will take time to develop. As we said, in the early days, judges will
dip in and out of the application, using it as one would a dictionary, or a refresher CLE on
the canons of contract interpretation. Only when lawyers start to argue that the tool can
provide better answers to interpretative questions will courts ask if that is true, and whether
answers from ChatGPT should supplant those from Merriam’s or Black’s dictionaries.

legal texts using large language models. Our work follows a rapidly evolving practice: Lawyers

and judges are already experimenting with these models in law offices and chambers across
the country, some covertly, others less so. We offered a deep dive into the way the technology
works (and fails) and explored techniques of using it to better perform interpretative tasks.
We demonstrated that the technique can be applied to famous contracts cases, often arriving
at the same answers at lower cost and with greater certainty, and while sometimes exposing
ambiguities, dislodging sticky priors about meaning, and parceling out the marginal effect of
new evidence on interpretation.
In our view, generative interpretation is a tool with important implications for legal
practice and contract theory. Because language models are attentive to context, and because
they can voraciously digest long texts, they offer a much more robust form of textualism.
The models’ complex encoding of language far outstrips that of any dictionary, and extensive
training data give them a superior sensitivity to actual usage. All of that promises a consider-
ably better way to predict meaning, but it won’t replace judges. Attempting to do so would
ignore the model’s real limitations, which include their opacity, hallucinatory nature, latent
biases, and susceptibility to adversarial attacks by sophisticated parties.
Keeping these limitations in mind, we argued that generative interpretation never-
theless paves an important middle ground between too-cold textualism and too-hot contex-
tualism. The traditional tradeoffs between textualism and contextualism take as a given that
our textualist inquiry must depend on dictionaries and that extrinsic evidence is necessarily
costly and prone to manipulation. Because generative interpretation is easy to deploy, cheap,
and accurate, and because it is not prone to those specific biases, it suggests a workable third
way. We argue that, given this technology, parties would prefer courts to ascertain meaning
using some extrinsic evidence. As such, generative interpretation will become a majoritarian
default.
With time, these discussions will spill over to even broader debates about statutory
and Constitutional interpretation, originalism and public meaning, and the relative compe-
tencies of courts and agencies to reach unbiased, predictable outcomes. We deferred direct
discussion of these issues, not least because we’re not competent to resolve them. This work,
nonetheless, fits into this broader interpretative project of assigning meaning to legal instru-
ments.
We close by offering a different sort of prediction. If, in fact, these models can ascer-
tain party intent to a close-enough approximation, it seems obvious that courts will (and
should) use them to make interpretation better. But if that’s really true, we wonder why
parties would continue to commit to contracts at all? Formal contracting is expensive. Why
not, instead, simply write out jointly-held goals at the beginning of the relationship and let

models spit out codes of conduct and legal responsibility as problems arise down the line?250
Or to put it differently, right now, generative AI looks like a promising judicial adjunct. But
the future of this technology is more disruptive by far: Formal contracts themselves may be
made obsolete. Or, at the very least, jurists should consider the marginal value of contracting
if the terms themselves are fairly determinable from the parties’ goals.
