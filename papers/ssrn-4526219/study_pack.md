## Elevator pitch

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that Large Language Models (LLMs) introduce "Generative Interpretation," a paradigm shift in legal text analysis. This approach enables AI to parse contracts, identify ambiguities, and predict judicial outcomes, offering a potentially cheaper, more accurate, and accessible method than traditional textualism or contextualism. He posits that generative interpretation can resolve long-standing interpretive debates, enhance access to justice, and fundamentally re-equip legal theory for AI's role as an active interpretive agent in contract law.
