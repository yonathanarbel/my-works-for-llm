## Elevator pitch

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that AI presents comprehensive, society-wide risks, from current harms like bias to potential existential threats, primarily due to the critical AI alignment problem. He advocates for systemic, precautionary regulation targeting AI as a technology, not just its applications. This approach is necessary due to AI's unique characteristics, its potential for rapid, unexpected advancements, and the inadequacy of existing legal frameworks. Arbel explores domestic, litigation-based, and international governance strategies to manage these profound challenges and ensure AI develops safely and beneficially.
