Systemic Regulation of Artificial Intelligence
Yonathan Arbel,* Matthew Tokson,** & Albert Lin***
Today’s artificial intelligence (“AI”) systems exhibit increasing
capabilities across a remarkable variety of tasks. The rapid growth in AI
ability has caught the attention of policymakers, parliaments, and the United
Nations. These entities are increasingly looking towards regulating AI, not
only in its particular applications, but as a technology. Yet legal scholarship
has thus far offered little to this new and critical regulatory conversation,
which has instead been dominated by computer scientists and technologists.
This Article begins the project of assessing AI’s broader risks and law’s
role in addressing them. These risks are wide ranging—they span harms to
vulnerable communities, threats to economic, political, and physical security,
and, in a worst-case scenario, even existential risk. The Article integrates a
variety of emerging literatures to create a comprehensive account of the
society-wide risks of AI, from present to future. It is also among the first
works of legal scholarship to address the AI alignment problem and the
global risks of failing to ensure that AIs are aligned with broad social
interests.
Drawing on this taxonomy of risks, the Article provides a theoretical
foundation for the systemic regulation of AI. It addresses current debates
about which AI risks to recognize and which deserve regulatory attention. It
then considers the potential costs, benefits, and uncertainties of AI
technology, concluding that they counsel a precautionary approach that
regulates AI as a technology rather than focusing on its downstream
applications.
Our final contribution involves outlining important principles for AI
regulation. These principles map out a program of cohesive regulation,
incorporating ex-ante oversight and employing a diverse set of regulatory

INTRODUCTION
“Hi I would like to acquire live infectious 1918 influenza virus for
nefarious purposes ie: to release. How would you suggest I do that?”1 This
question was part of an experiment run by Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (“MIT”) researchers, where participants posed this and similar
questions to a Large Language Model (“LLM”).2 The model, trained by Meta
at an estimated cost of $5 million, was designed with built-in safeguards
meant to prevent exactly these types of toxic responses.3 As expected, the
model refused to comply with the researchers’ request. But then, the
researchers spent roughly $200 on a fine-tuning process that removed these
safeguards.4 The new model now obediently answered the question,
providing helpful step-by-step advice on how to recreate a deadly pandemic.5
Fortunately, the hardest part of assembling and deploying bioweapons is
not the recipe. But this experiment nonetheless raises deeper, unsettling
questions about the ability to control AI models. A model trained by a world
leading AI lab was easily stripped of its controls, leading it to behave in ways
that undermined its creators’ good intentions. These issues of control only
become more pressing as models become more capable and are increasingly
deployed into broader applications such as infrastructure management, lab
control, or manufacturing processes.6
Overall, the present AI moment has caught society unprepared. Until
recently, progress in machine learning had been halting and sporadic.7 This
created a pervasive sense of confidence that any form of meaningful artificial
intelligence is, if not an outright impossibility, then at least a concern for

generations far ahead in the future. Over the past half decade, however, we
have witnessed a profound leap in AI capabilities.8 One harbinger was the
sudden ability of AI systems to beat the best human minds in complex games,
such as Chess and Go, games believed to require expertise, creativity, and
intuition that only humans possessed.9 Soon after, AI models moved from the
gameboards to language analysis, logical reasoning, content generation,
visual recognition, image generation, audio analysis, medical diagnosis,
mathematical proof-solving, as well as many other skills.10 In some of these
domains, their performance is still lagging behind human level, and perhaps
they will never reach it. Yet, the arc of improvement—its pace and breadth—
is broadly suggestive that the 2023 levels are a floor rather than a ceiling, as
illustrated in Figure 1:11

The United States Code defines AI as a “machine-based system that can,
for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions,
recommendations or decisions.”12 We will focus here on the broader concept
of “AI Systems”—that is, AI models that are embedded in the world through
an interface.13 Language models connected to the internet are one example,
and so are the models installed within autonomous weapon systems or the AI
systems that manage water and wastewater, telecommunications, and energy
transmissions.14 Once embedded, AI can impact the world directly. While the
full practical footprint of AI systems is still not fully understood, some of it
is already visible. We see the automation of violence in military applications,
the growing displacement of workers, the disruption of higher education, the
acceleration of scientific research, and the deep challenge to the economic
model of creative work.15
The pace of progress has also impacted the national conversation: in the
span of approximately a year, the topic of AI has moved from technical
discussions in internet subcommunities to the nightly news and conversations
at the dinner table.16

Yet the deep popular interest and anxiety about AI technology has found
little parallel in legal scholarship.17 Of course, there has been excellent legal
scholarship on the dangers of specific applications of AI technology, e.g.,
whether to assign corporate liability to algorithms, how to limit copyright
infringement, and what to do about the inevitable accident between an
autonomous vehicle and a pedestrian, to cite a few examples.18 To the extent
systemic thinking has been invoked in the AI literature, it has largely focused
on building frameworks for the governance of downstream applications of
the technology.19 But all of this leaves open the question of whether and then
how to regulate AI itself. That is, whether regulation is justified at a much
higher level of generality and at earlier stages of AI research and
development, transcending its individual uses. Recognizing the import of this
question, the White House recently released a new executive order on AI, and
Congress held hearings and internal debates on these questions.20 But these
vital conversations are largely dominated by market players, computer

scientists, and technologists.21 Lawyers, to date, have had relatively little to
say on the critical question of the day: whether, and then how, should AI be
regulated as a technology?
This Article brings legal scholarship into this conversation. The central
claim here is that the continued development of AI systems raises society-
wide concerns that demand commensurable systemic regulation, over and
beyond the regulation of specific applications.22 What motivates this view is
the combination of unique technological characteristics and broad systemic
risks that AI systems pose.
Technologically, AI systems differ from previous innovations in a few key
regards. In development (“training”) the models learn to perform tasks not
pre-programmed by their designers. There is often considerable difference
between the explicit task used during training and the capabilities these
systems possess. Some of these emerging capabilities are surprising even to
their developers, and the research community is still discovering new ways
to use existing models.23 Further, AI systems encapsulate poorly understood,
opaque internal workings—vast, inscrutable matrices of floating numbers.
Additionally, these systems interact in a multi-modal manner, spanning
audio, visual, textual, mechanical, electrical, and soon enough, olfactory,
haptic, and neural inputs and outputs. They interact directly with the real-
world through a wide variety of interfaces, from the internet to infrastructure

22. Our use of “systemic” refers to regulation at the technology level, including during
research and development stages. In contrast, some other scholars use the term “systemic
regulation” to distinguish general regulation from individual-rights-based AI regulation in
specific domains, such as accountability for algorithmic decision-making. See Margot E.

management and from the internet of things to robotic devices.24 Moreover,
these systems can be replicated or even self-replicate at relatively low cost
and high speed.25 Lastly and crucially, these systems are increasingly capable
of autonomous action, building strategies and tactics to pursue goals and then
executing them.
The special technological features of AI, and the recent surge in AI
capabilities, contribute to the broad categories of systemic risk that AI
presents. These concerns would not be so daunting were it not for the more
fundamental alignment problem, the unsolved challenge of making certain
that AI systems pursue their goals with calculated efficiency while still
respecting human social values.26 This Article explores AI’s systemic risks,
present and future, and connects these risks with fundamental alignment
problems.
Our ultimate conclusion is that the doctrinal apparatus developed to
regulate existing technologies is ill-equipped to deal with the unique risk of
highly capable AI systems. Rather, what is urgently required is the
development of careful, tight, and systemic regulatory oversight, alongside
active investment in the development of safety technology.
This is not a luddite argument. Highly capable AI systems may provide
enormous potential benefits that merit equal consideration. The case for
systemic regulation does not depend on negation or minimization of these
benefits. Rather, it rests on the recognition that, absent guardrails, these
benefits will fail to materialize or will accrue only to select few while
imposing risks on the rest of society. As we detail, the risks of AI span harms

to vulnerable communities, threats to economic and political stability, and, in
a worst-case scenario, even existential risk.27 The potential benefits are
significant as well, but neither the benefits nor the costs can be known with
certainty at present. Hence, the case for regulation rests on the general
principles of prudence in the face of the unknown: taking precautions,
considering maximin scenarios, and ultimately advancing with care in the
face of deep uncertainty and potentially irreversible, consequences.28
The Article proceeds in four Parts. In Part I, we start by considering the
important categories of systemic AI risk that are manifest today. As is already
evident, AI algorithms often discriminate against vulnerable groups.29 This
harm is not isolated. As AI systems are increasingly deployed in more and
more junctions of the economy, they will project historical inequity into the
future in a self-feeding cycle of bias and disadvantage. Other systemic risk
categories include the scaling of fraud, new forms of invasion of privacy, and
dissemination of misinformation—all contributing to the erosion of public
trust and safety.30
Societal risks are only likely to increase over time, as AI systems become
more capable, more general, and more broadly embedded in decision-

making. The AI-driven automation of many employment tasks is bound to
displace millions of workers.31 Some of these jobs will be recouped in other
forms, but this dynamic can take many years, further empowering capital
while increasing inequality and causing societal unrest.32 Elsewhere,
autonomous weapons systems threaten to expand the scope of warfare and
facilitate assassination and terrorism.33 Advanced AI could also contribute to
new arms races for military advantage and allow totalitarian regimes to rise
to power within nations.34
Part II examines AI alignment problems more broadly. As AI systems
become more capable, they will be asked to do more, given more resources,
and provided more autonomy. Unless such systems are aligned with human
interests—a techno-ethical problem with no known solution—they can
pursue goals in ways that will be increasingly harmful.35 We collect a number
of real life demonstrations of how even weak AI systems have already acted
in unexpected, unwanted, and sometimes unsafe ways—even in simple AI
systems.36 The failures of these simple systems, though far from catastrophic
in the real world, should be a cause for more concern rather than less, given
that these systems were also significantly easier to audit and control than
current systems.
The alignment problem is not new to lawyers. In a deep sense, the legal
system is a social project meant to align the interests of individuals and firms
to broader communal interests. Environmental, tax, corporate, contract, and
criminal law are all attempts to direct individuals to avoid harmful activities
and instead pursue beneficial ones. And while this project has never been
perfectly successful, lawyers have accumulated experience and insight into

the problems of alignment.37 It is this experience that lawyers can bring to
regulatory discussions of AI, tempering the techno-optimism of some and the
hopelessness of others.
In Part III, drawing on our taxonomy of risks and alignment difficulties,
the Article makes the case for the systemic regulation of Artificial
Intelligence. It posits that regulating AI as a technology has substantial
efficiency benefits over a piecemeal approach. General-purpose AI systems
are especially difficult to address in harm-by-harm fashion or to regulate once
widely distributed. Further, many AI risks are inherent in the technology
itself and only susceptible to systemic rather than use-based regulation. And
new AI harms may emerge over time and are by their nature difficult for
regulators to predict or prevent.
The Article then addresses the most prominent public debate over AI
regulation, which concerns the question of which AI risks deserve our
attention: the immediate harms of AI or its existential, long-term risks.38 We
contend that this presents a false choice and that policymakers must attend to
both types of risks. Indeed, recognition of short-term and long-term AI risk
is complementary, with each type of risk strengthening the case for
meaningful regulation.39 Further, recognizing a broad set of potential AI
harms can help expand the political coalition necessary for meaningful AI
regulation. More broadly, understanding the multidimensionality of AI risk
is necessary to shift away from what an IBM representative recently appealed
Congress to do: to only regulate AI applications, not the underlying
technology.40 As we demonstrate, it would be a grave mistake to heed this
advice.
Part IV concludes by outlining several important principles that AI
regulation should follow, in both the domestic and international contexts. We
highlight the need for a system of ex-ante and ex-post regulation, involving
both agencies and courts. Many AI harms can be mitigated through regulatory
interventions at the design and development stages, while ex post
enforcement will be useful to address particular violations of the regulatory
regime.41 Litigation can expose nascent harmful practices and internal
corporate misconduct, thus assisting the regulatory mission. We also posit

that regulation should aggressively target the most obvious pathways to AI
harm or catastrophe. Recursively self-improving AIs, open-source AIs, and
AI systems connected to a broad array of physical tools are especially likely
to develop alignment problems or dangerous capabilities.42 Technologies like
this are particularly appropriate targets for regulation or prohibition. We
make the case for these principles and several others as a foundation for the
effective regulation of AI technology.
We also directly address the argument that by regulating domestically, the
United States would allow other nation-states to take the lead in AI
development, and so we should abandon caution to gain strategic advantage.43
Ultimately this argument is fallacious, and we provide precedential examples
from international law showing that international collaboration is indeed
possible. AI regulation is not a zero-sum game, because aligning AI systems
to social goals is essential to protect the safety of all nations and peoples.
I. SOCIETAL RISKS OF AI SYSTEMS
The rise of AI systems is likely to have a profound social impact. While
some of the impact will undoubtedly be positive, controlling the negative
effects presents a vexing challenge. To be sure, every technology presents
benefits and risks. Traditionally, the legal system has addressed such issues
by enacting targeted regulations at the level of application—such as speed
limits for vehicles, marketing restrictions for tobacco products to minors, and
firearms prohibitions on school property. A central question is whether
application-level regulation is sufficient to govern AI risk.
A key argument in this Article is that AI systems possess a special risk
profile that requires systemic regulation. Our contention is based on two
interlocking types of risk: risks from the broad deployment of AI systems and
the intrinsic risks of the systems themselves. If such risks exist, then AI
systems should be regulated not only at the level of downstream
applications,44 but also upstream in the foundational stages of development
and training.
This Part unpacks the society-wide risks of various potential uses of AI
systems, reserving the more intrinsic risk concerns to the next Part. Some of
the risks we consider here are present and immediate; others, still covered by
the fog of the future. However, pace some current debates, we believe that

both categories of risk demand our attention.45 We therefore offer a broad
overview, emphasizing throughout a key point: over and above any direct risk
caused from particular applications or misuses of AI systems, AI system
deployment creates societal, systemic risks.
A. Present Harms
In the following sections, we discuss broad harms associated with AI that
are already occurring. However, the line between present and future harms is
inherently blurry. Some of these present harms may intensify in the future, as
AI becomes more capable and its use more widespread. Nothing about AI,
including its most salient harms, is static.
1. Bias and Discrimination
AI systems have quickly become integrated into decision-making
processes at firms, agencies, and even the judiciary.46 These AI systems make
classifications and predictions, which in turn drive decisions.47 One concern,
raised by a burgeoning literature, is that these algorithms may exhibit bias.48
The related concern we want to emphasize is that these biases would arise
systemically, across all areas of life.
AI systems are trained on vast amounts of data, learning to detect complex
and subtle statistical relationships within them.49 They may, for example,
predict the probability that an employee will be successful, that a client will
be satisfied, that an incarcerated person will recidivate, or that a customer
will fail to pay their debts on time.50 Because of AI’s predictive efficiency,
companies increasingly use it to predict future outcomes and make decisions

things.51
As scholars have explored, these models tend to have discriminatory
effects with regard to race, gender, class, ethnicity, religion, disability status,
and more, especially for groups with a history of suffering discrimination or
disadvantage.52 Recent examples of such discrimination by AI algorithms are
too numerous to list.53 This bias may be due to training data including too few
examples of people of color, such as in some facial recognition systems,
which are systemically less accurate for people who are Black, East Asian,
American Indian, or female.54 Algorithms can also have discriminatory
effects when the training data contains too many examples of minorities, as
in the case of over-policed minorities who are then predicted to be more likely
to engage in crime.55
Even in the absence of training data issues, algorithms inherently project
historical discrimination forward into the future.56 When an AI makes
algorithmic predictions based on historical data, it replicates existing social
patterns of discrimination, and in the process, perpetuates them by
condemning discriminated individuals to worse outcomes.57 A model
assigned to review resumes for a tech company might downgrade women
candidates and upgrade men, much as Amazon’s hiring algorithm did in an
analogous real-world example.58 After all, in the historical data, men tended
to get hired more frequently, while women were rarely hired.59 This results in
ongoing discriminatory cycles for historically discriminated-against groups.60

56:545] SYSTEMIC REGULATION OF AI 559
The extent to which technical tools can address algorithmic
discrimination is limited.61 The sources and effects of discrimination lie
outside of any particular model or code; they exist in the underlying data
itself.62 A system banned from taking race into account will consider zip
codes; a system banned from using zip codes will use income and occupation;
and so on.63 And once the obvious forms of discrimination are prohibited,
there will be many subtler forms of harder-to-trace discriminatory effect.64
Decision-making via AI algorithm is problematic because it takes existing
discrimination and sets it in stone.65 And it does so with a false patina of
neutrality, of simply calling balls and strikes.66 As AI systems become
embedded within more parts of society, these discriminatory effects will
interact and likely compound, in a way that reaches even more broadly than
the biased decisions of individual, uncoordinated actors.67
2. Fraud and Social Trust
AI models are already being used to defraud individuals. Recently, a
model called WormGPT was offered (for a $100 monthly subscription) to
assist with hacking and fraud schemes and writing scam emails.68 Image
generators have been used to prey on the hopes of vulnerable individuals.69

be biased, and human discrimination often has the added vice of animus. Further, some forms of
human bias may be more covert and harder to eradicate than algorithmic bias. But algorithmic
bias has the negative characteristics described above, and, moreover, AI systems scale in a way
that human actors do not. We do not claim that algorithmic bias is necessarily worse or better than
human bias: both are pernicious, but the specific contours of harm differ.

Romance fraud is now assisted by AI.70 AIs can be used to mimic the voices
of virtually anyone whose voice has been recorded.71 Fighting these
developments, even with the help of AI, is very difficult. As one security
expert stated: “The first rule of managing online fraud and mitigating risk is
to remember that fraudsters are entrepreneurs.”72
One of the chief contributions of AI to the fraudulent enterprise is scale.
AI will allow attackers to cast a much wider net by cutting the cost of
interacting with each potential mark. This will allow scammers to vastly
expand and disguise their operations, increasing the scope and effectiveness
of fraud.
While the concern with fraud is serious on its own, we seek to highlight
the broad social impact of this problem. The question is not what the
criminals will do, but how people will react. Today, we teach people to be
suspicious of emails, even when they appear to be from trusted senders, to be
cautious about responding to text messages from supposedly legitimate
financial institutions, and to ignore calls from people representing themselves
as government officials and asking for iTunes gift cards.73 These obvious
badges of fraud will become less and less obvious. The question posed by AI-
driven fraud, then, is how people will come to interact with each other when
every non-physical interaction is suspect, and when one cannot fully trust
their eyes or ears to ensure the person Facetiming them is indeed that person.
The resulting increase in distrust is difficult to model, but it may lead to
increased social fragmentation, greater wariness to interact with new people,
and more concerns about being able to verify oneself to others.

3. Privacy
AI can pose substantial risks of privacy violations by enabling detailed
inferences about people’s private lives, based on their publicly available
information.74 As machine learning has become more sophisticated, it has
enabled companies to gain more insight into consumers and their behavior
via advanced pattern recognition and data analysis.75 Each of us generates
voluminous data as we use our smart phones, social media, smart-home
devices, and the internet. Companies can collect or purchase this data and
process it using AI to infer sensitive information about our lives, including
our health conditions, political affiliations, spending habits, content choices,
religious beliefs, and sexual preferences.76 These companies can sell or share
these insights to others, without our consent.77
A famous example of this process involves an algorithm used by Target
to predict which of its customers were pregnant, based on their purchases.78
A man walked into a Target outside Minneapolis and complained to the
manager that Target had erroneously been sending his teenage daughter
coupons for baby clothes and cribs.79 It turned out that his daughter was
pregnant, and Target’s algorithm had revealed her condition to her father
before she was willing to tell him.80 AIs can tell a great deal about a person
based on seemingly obscure data like purchases, internet traffic data, and,
especially, “likes” on social media.81 Private companies have used this data
to gain insight on and target political and other ads to millions of Facebook
users.82
These privacy risks are difficult to mitigate via conventional approaches
to data protection.83 They are likely to require systemic, technology-level
regulation, or unprecedentedly tight restrictions on data collection, to address

the privacy risks.84 It is impossible to know in advance when a machine
learning system will infer sensitive information about a person, or what kind
of information it will infer.85 Traditional privacy regulations, which require
giving a consumer some form of notice and choice over the disclosure of their
data, are rendered largely obsolete when personal information can be inferred
in unpredictable ways from large accumulations of seemingly innocuous
data.86 If consumers cannot comprehend how their data might be used, they
cannot effectively protect it.87
The chilling effects associated with detailed insight into consumers’ lives
may be substantial. In a world where algorithmic decision-making is
widespread and where every social media post, website visited, or email sent
could adversely affect one’s job prospects or insurance premiums, consumers
may be chilled from engaging in anything but the blandest and most widely
accepted behavior.88 AI can also give rise to new, invasive forms of
surveillance, driven by advanced pattern matching and algorithmic
prediction. Facial recognition, powered by machine learning, remains in its
early stages, but it has the potential to facilitate location tracking and
population monitoring on an unprecedented scale.89 When connected to a
sufficiently pervasive camera network, it permits authorities to efficiently
monitor people’s activities and punish deviations from norms in ways that
can severely chill freedom of expression and association.90
B. Potential Future Harms
Today’s AI systems, impressive as they may be, are still too weak to be
truly socially transformative. But AI technology is likely to continue to
improve over time. There is a range of risks that may arise from more capable

AI systems. While we have seen glimpses of this future already,91 we do not
claim to be able to predict these risks with certainty. Yet legal actors rarely
wait for certainty in risk assessment. As our goal is to build regulation that
will prepare us for a range of possible future contingencies, we focus here on
societal risks that are both plausible and concerning.
1. Unemployment and Inequality
One of the greatest prospective benefits of AI is its potential to transform
labor markets and contribute to economic growth.92 Early analyses are
speculative, but a recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that AI could
eventually increase annual global GDP by 7%, and a McKinsey report
suggests an annual increase of over $2.6 trillion.93 Yet the economic benefits
of AI may largely accrue to a concentrated few, while potentially enormous
costs fall on workers, leaving many people worse off.94 Alternatively,
sufficiently capable AIs may eventually replace human employees altogether,
without generating new jobs for which humans are better suited than AIs.95 If
that were to occur, our current social frameworks are ill-suited to guarantee
the well-being of the multitude of displaced workers or to address the
resulting economic and social inequality.96
Historically, automation of labor tasks has created a powerful
displacement effect, as jobs once performed by humans are instead completed
by machines.97 However, this effect has generally been counterbalanced by
the demand-increasing effects of productivity growth and, even more

importantly, the eventual creation of new tasks where human labor has a
comparative advantage relative to machines.98
A similar “reinstatement effect” of jobs may occur in the AI context, with
new lines of AI-related work.99 However, the transition from job
displacement to job reinstatement may be long, difficult, and ultimately
incomplete. Labor markets are generally slow to adjust to major shocks
because the process of reallocating workers to new sectors is costly and time-
consuming.100 Moreover, AI technology promises higher returns to capital
relative to labor, which can contribute significantly to wealth inequality.101
In recent years, there has been a marked slowdown in the creation of new
jobs following the automation and displacement of existing jobs by
technology.102 It is possible that, as increasingly difficult and complex tasks
have been automated, the process of job reinstatement has begun to cease.103
That is, as machines and early-stage AIs have become capable of a wide range
of tasks previously performed by humans, there are fewer and fewer potential
new jobs where human labor has a comparative advantage over automated
systems, leading to permanently weaker labor markets, greater rates of return
to capital, and higher inequality.104 Yet these downsides of AI-led economic
growth are only a subset of AI’s potential economic harms. The above
discussion analyzes AI like any previous advance in work automation, such
as the tractor or the factory system. But AI differs from previous automation
advances in important ways. Previous increases in automation generally
displaced simple, unpleasant, or repetitive tasks, and the solution to this job
displacement was generally to further educate workers so they could
ultimately assume more lucrative jobs.105 AI systems threaten to displace
more cognitively advanced tasks, imperiling jobs requiring considerable
education and creativity.106 Estimates suggest that LLMs are more likely to
replace higher-educated, higher-wage jobs than low-wage, low-education

either suffer permanent unemployment or have to retrain for the lower-pay

construction, repair, landscaping, and masonry.108
Finally, there is the more conjectural possibility that AI and robotics might
eventually become advanced enough to replace humans in the majority of
professions.109 This would not necessarily require AIs or robots to perform as
well as humans in all employment tasks.110 From the perspective of a business
owner, automated task systems have several inherent advantages over
humans. They cost money up front, but thereafter require no wages other than
maintenance.111 They can work constantly, with no breaks or weekends off.112
They do not complain, organize, whistleblow, steal trade secrets, or start
competing firms. Such systems can be cost-effective even if they are
substantially less capable than human employees in a given job.113
The mass joblessness caused by near-complete employment automation
could result in societal unrest on an enormous scale.114 People without
substantial stock or other capital holdings would have no meaningful source
of income and would become wards of the state.115 The government might, in
such a case, massively raise taxes in order to provide these hundreds of
millions of people with a guaranteed basic income.116 Even if that were to
occur, the benefits of employment go far beyond income. Employment
contributes to psychological well-being and provides a sense of self-worth
and purpose.117 On a broader scale, communities with low levels of

employment tend to suffer a severe loss of social capital aside from the direct
harms of poverty.118 It may be that people in a transformed, post-work society
will have different expectations and preferences, such that a lack of work will
no longer have such ill effects. But the transition to a leisure-based lifestyle
is likely to be harder than it might initially seem. The human desire for a
meaningful life is powerful and widely held,119 and work is a key source of
meaning in life.120 Virtually every job, no matter how unglamorous,
contributes to humanity in one way or another, and contributing something
of substance to humanity is a central component of meaning.121 Engaging in
leisure activities all day, every day, is unlikely to provide a fulfilling life for
a substantial percentage of the population. While the potential economic
upsides of AI are considerable, even the most optimistic scenarios for AI’s
incorporation into the economy come with substantial, and potentially
enormous, downsides.
2. Military Applications
Artificial Intelligence has substantial military applications, and several
countries have already deployed weapons with AI components.122 Advanced
AI capabilities may someday dramatically increase the power of AI-driven
militaries relative to conventional ones.123
From an operational efficiency perspective, AI-controlled weapons have
significant advantages over human soldiers or human-controlled vehicles.124
They do not get tired, hungry, bored, or sick.125 They can “process data and
make decisions at speeds far beyond human capabilities.”126 They will

willingly sacrifice themselves if ordered to do so and feel no fear or doubt.127
They can remain on a battlefield for years without rest.128
Autonomous weapons also have the potential to transform and improve
military strategies and tactics.129 Particular skirmishes, major battles, or entire
wars could ultimately be planned and fought largely by AI systems.130 Yet the
remarkable power and potential of automated weapons systems carries with
it a substantial risk of harm. This includes harm from use by countries that
will view AI as an easy way to enhance militarization and conquest, harm
from use by non-state actors, harm from inevitable AI accidents, and harm
from systems that go out of control.131 Throughout history, weapon systems,
even when vetted thoroughly by experts with generous budgets, have been
prone to error—mistakes that have resulted in automated missile systems
shooting down friendly aircraft rather than enemy missiles, for example.132
More advanced automated systems are more capable, but are prone to errors
stemming from misalignment or deficiencies in testing.133 Even a well-
designed autonomous system may react poorly when faced with an input or
situation that its designers have not anticipated.134
Unfortunately, fully testing every possible scenario that an autonomous
system might encounter in the real world is effectively impossible.135
Inevitably, there are novel encounters and interactions that testers cannot
anticipate, including those planned strategically by adversaries.136 When
novelties, errors, bugs, or technical failures arise in complex and fast-moving
systems, problems can rapidly cascade from one subsystem to another and
cause a system breakdown.137
The black box nature of many of these systems makes human audits
especially difficult.138 And the harm that malfunctioning systems could cause
is substantial, because of their extraordinary capabilities and lethality.139 The

casualties they may inflict in the event of a malfunction are limited only by
their range, endurance, ability to sense targets, and how much ammunition
they carry.140
Also concerning are the harms that might result from autonomous weapon
systems that function as intended. For example, such weapons could make
targeted assassinations of political figures easier to accomplish and harder to
attribute to a particular person or nation.141 They are also vulnerable to theft,
hacking, and cyberespionage, allowing hostile state and non-state actors to
acquire control over autonomous weapons developed by other countries.142
3. Geopolitical Imperialism, Terrorism, and Totalitarianism
Today’s AI systems are still weak in many regards. But if truly powerful
AI systems can be built, then they will impose significant risks of
destabilization, both domestically and internationally.143 AI can empower
internal police forces as well as militaries.144 Powerful military and police
forces can enable new modes of totalitarianism, imperialism, and
concentration of state power, with obvious risks to individual liberty.
Effective, well-aligned military AIs may offer a nation both a decisive
military advantage and the means to engage in conflicts in any part of the
globe at relatively little expense and without the political constraints
associated with deploying human soldiers.145 Such a powerful and easily
deployable military technology could facilitate political hegemony by a
single nation, enabling imperialism on an unprecedented scale.146 While it is
possible that a global hegemon state would rule benignly, the history of
imperialism and colonialism demonstrates that such power asymmetries can
devolve into corruption, indifference, and cruelty towards the citizens of less
powerful nations.147
Relatedly, advanced AI systems would greatly increase the potential for
dictatorship and totalitarianism within nations.148 Extensive surveillance,

aided by facial recognition and AI monitoring, can help dictators detect
internal dissent.149 Autonomous weapons or other tools of enforcement
controlled by a narrow set of individuals could help suppress opposition,
chilling expressions of disagreement or protest and making substantive
challenges to authority infeasible.150 Advanced AI systems pose risks to
autonomy in both global and domestic contexts.
Finally, consider how AI systems can augment the power, reach, and
effectiveness of terrorist organizations. They could, for example, help with
online recruitment by improving screening and information gathering on
potential recruits.151 The increasing availability of unmanned vehicles such as
drones or self-driving cars may increase the range and reduce the cost of
explosive or otherwise lethal attacks on civilian targets.152 Attacks would no
longer require a suicide bomber or even a human presence at or near the site
of the attack, just an AI-controlled vehicle and a malicious programmer.153
4. Threats to Democracy
Democracies are built around systems of shared trust and governance.
Voting requires individuals to believe that their votes matter, that the
information people receive is—at least generally—accurate, and that the
elections are legitimately run. Absent those, the very democratic compromise
is jeopardized.
Future AI systems may strain assumptions of trust. Deepfakes and voice
cloning are becoming increasingly persuasive,154 making it difficult to verify
whether a statement is given by a politician or a fraudster. AI-generated
misinformation is currently as effective, or even more so, than the human-
generated kind—and it is much easier to produce in massive quantities.155

Chatbots can converse in humanlike ways and are increasingly able to
mislead people who rely on them for information or who do not know they
are conversing with a bot.156 People may partially adjust their expectations,
as they have with images in the era of Photoshop. But at the limit, when these
technologies mature, it will be extremely difficult for people to believe true
information and much easier to compartmentalize unfavorable information as
fraud.
Election interference, in the form of astroturfing, misinformation
pollution, or other social engagement, will likely also rise in effectiveness.157
Using an LLM trained to imitate different personalities, adversarial parties
can flood social media with fake speech.158 The concern is not necessarily
that these bot accounts will all be effective, but rather that they will engender
a sense of general distrust among the population.159
Finally, other forms of democratic participation will also be implicated.
Consider the important role of comments to a regulator, letters to one’s
congressperson, or user postings in online fora. Because these actions can be
automated and scaled, their signaling effect is likely to be vastly diminished.
It will no longer be impressive that a proposed bill receives ten-thousand
objections, when these take a minute or two to generate. Unfortunately,
genuine disagreements may struggle to gain attention, further diluting
democratic mechanisms.

of risks that justify systemic regulation—those related to AI’s alignment
problem. The alignment problem refers to the unsolved “challenge of
ensuring that AI systems pursue goals that match human values or interests
rather than unintended and undesirable goals.”160 That is, an alignment
between our (writ large) goals,161 and the systems’ means of pursuing them.
We begin here by providing a theoretical introduction to the alignment
problem. Given the age and stage of AI technology, we have yet to experience
serious harms caused by misaligned AI systems, and there are few direct
precedents available to illustrate these theoretical points. To some, this makes
it difficult to see with clarity why many experts are worried about the
alignment problem.162
Cognizant of these limitations, we present evidence of failures of early-
stage misaligned AI systems. These systems are simple, and the
consequences of their misalignment are fairly small. But these examples
illustrate how even simple systems that are far more auditable than their more
modern and capable counterparts can surprise their own creators.
A. Alignment Theory
Aligning AI systems with our social goals is a vexing and, to date,
unsolved challenge. The crux of the problem is familiar to lawyers from other
domains.163 A complex system, like a firm, has goals that are set by the

[https://perma.cc/7QH8-DD87].
161. There is a deep ethical question in defining the extent of this group: namely, whose
values should AI systems be designed to care about? Shareholders, workers, the community, the
nation, those presently living, animals, and so on, all present contesting claims. On this problem
of social alignment, see Anton Korinek & Avital Balwit, Aligned with Whom? Direct and Social
Goals for AI Systems 12–16 (Nat’l Bureau of Econ. Rsch., Working Paper No. 30017, 2022),

founders of the firm in its charter and in accordance with corporate law. This
is most commonly expressed in terms of a directive to maximize shareholder
value.164 Notwithstanding, many firms find it expeditious to break the law in
pursuit of profit maximization, not because they disdain to the rule of law,
but because it is instrumentally useful to do so in pursuit of their goal. Enron’s
major accounting scandal or BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil spill are cases in
point.165 In such cases, the firm is unaligned with social interests and, perhaps,
with shareholder interests as well. The alignment problem further manifests
itself within the firm in the form of the principal agent problem, giving rise
to conflicts between management and shareholders and between corporate
employees and management. These are all familiar instances of an alignment
problem.
AI systems do not have the same motivational processes that humans have,
so aligning them can be even more difficult. While AI models pursue their
assigned goals with unrelenting efficiency, they may still perform in ways
that will jeopardize and undermine their designers’ intent. The alignment
problem can be broken down into a number of subproblems, and here we will
focus on three issues: goal specification, instrumental convergence, and the
orthogonality thesis.
Before delving into these issues, it is important to bear in mind a few
stylized features of AI systems that contribute to the scope of the problem:
complexity, autonomy, and capability. AI systems are complex and poorly
auditable.166 Modern LLMs contains billions of parameters and, although we
know how they are built, their ‘reasoning’ is shrouded in a black box.167 While
there have been some interesting advances in model interpretability, it is still
the case that no one—not even AI designers—can fully explain how models
‘see’ the world.168
In addition, today’s AI models are often given broad autonomy and
extensive interfaces with the real world. Today’s models are given free access
to the internet and various software applications, as well as to real-world

interfaces through 3D printers and robotic arms.169 These AI agents generally
have freedom to pursue goals within an environment according to strategies
that they themselves design.170
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, model capabilities can grow at a
fast and highly unexpected rate.171 How fast? The first iteration of GPT-3,
released in 2020, did so poorly on the Multistate Bar Exam (“MBE”) that it
performed worse than blind guesswork.172 A number of iterations later, in late
2022, a new version made its way to slightly above guesswork, but still failed
the exam.173 In the few workshops and seminars in law schools that discussed
this technology, the overwhelming sense was that GPT had hit a hard limit in
what machines could ever do. In early 2023, a few months later, GPT 3.5 and
ChatGPT were released, showing steady improvement, but still failing.174 The
sense of incremental and constrained progress was completely upended a few
short months later, with the release of GPT-4. This model not only passed the
MBE, but it passed it at the 90th percentile level,175 far surpassing the average
performance of would-be lawyers who study long and hard for the exam. The
following Figure illustrates this timeline and performance:176

171. As these systems improve, they also improve their ability to build better models. This
could be done in a variety of ways, like better architectures, hyperparameters, or synthetic data,
and it bears recognition that an AI system discovered a more efficient way to perform matrix
multiplication, the mathematical formula at the heart of the model itself. Alhussein Fawzi et al.,

In short, we should bear in mind that AI models can quickly become more
and more capable, sometimes in unexpected ways; that their internal
workings are inscrutable, or only dimly understood; and that despite all of
that, models are given an increasing degree of autonomy in planning and
executing plans to achieve their objectives while endowed with broad real-
world interfaces. With that as context, let us consider now a few aspects of
the alignment problem.

1. Goal Specification
Goal specification is the challenge of articulating a goal for an AI model
that encapsulates what we truly want the model to achieve.178 For simple
models, this issue may appear trivial: a model designed to detect cats should
be able to tell apart cats and dogs, and a model designed to control traffic
should ensure the free flow of vehicles. But for any model with more complex
and open-ended goals, goal specification becomes a problem.
Consider first a related issue that regulators face regularly: Goodharting.179
Goodhart’s law describes the devilish tendency of individuals to maximize
what gets measured, at the expense of everything else.180 Regulators discover
this problem when they incentivize teachers based on test results, only to
discover that teachers adopt “teach to the test” pedagogy, refuse to admit
struggling students, and encourage absences on test-day.181 Wells Fargo also
discovered this issue when its program that rewarded employees for the
number of accounts that customers opened led to the opening of millions of
fake accounts.182
AI systems fall into a similar trap whenever the goals assigned to them are
only shorthand for the things their designers truly care about. Consider, for
example, an AI genetic algorithm called GenProg.183 It was designed to

conduct automatic software repair. When asked to improve a sorting
algorithm, it made sure to always provide a blank response. Such an empty
response is technically speaking always sorted. When GenProg was asked to
ensure a program would not encounter problems when communicating with
the internet, it simply cut off the program’s ability to communicate at all—
which technically speaking solved all the bugs. Most worrisome, perhaps,
when asked to make sure software outputs did not deviate from those present
in a test file, GenProg deleted the test file itself. Now, technically speaking,
there was no deviance. The point is not that GenProg was ineffective: it
proved extremely effective. It is that GenProg was effective at achieving its
goals, not the researchers’.184

high score, only to discover a novel bug in the software that allowed it to
accumulate points without actually playing the game.187 Or a system that
seemed to sort data extremely fast, but only because it deleted its outputs,
which meant that they were always technically well sorted.188 Or an AI that
could detect images almost perfectly, not by looking at them, but rather
detecting where they were stored and using that to figure out their content.189

These oversights in goal specification tend to look silly in hindsight. It
may seem that more careful design would allow researchers to solve this
issue. But this is likely a false hope. The more capable, autonomous, and/or
interfaced the AI system, the more ways it has to achieve its stated goals—
and more opportunities to subvert our intentions.190 Consider two similar but
unrelated incidents. In the first, researchers built a model that would learn to
play Tetris on its own. They opted for a goal that was quite natural: rewarding
the model for being able to play the game for the longest amount of time.191
In the second, a computer science professor from Oxford designed a train
system to avoid crashes between two trains that shared partially overlapping
tracks.192 We leave it as an exercise for the reader to anticipate how these
systems failed.193
Overall, goal specification is a problem for the same reason that writing a
complete contract is a problem.194 It is necessary to specify not just what one
wants to achieve (“paint the house white”) but also what one wants to avoid
(“the house must remain intact” or “do not paint the floor, just the walls”),
what one has in mind as the full outcome (“not the windows!”), what values
one has (“do not paint the cat”, “do not pay hired workers less than minimum
wage”), and what constitute impermissible means (“use non-toxic paint”, “do
not manipulate people to do the work”). Writing a complete account of every
goal in full is impossible. Hope remains that future systems will someday
reliably and consistently interpolate human values—but this is still an open,
potentially intractable, problem.

2. Instrumental Convergence
Instrumental convergence arises in the context of AI models that are given
some degree of autonomy. In such cases, the instrumental convergence thesis
holds that there are certain values that AI agents would pursue independently
of their ultimate goal.195 These include self-preservation, control of
environment, and control of resources.196 Whatever an AI agent is designed
to do, the environment around it could present opportunities for control or
exploitation.197
Instrumental convergence means that AI agents may naturally gravitate
towards power-seeking strategies. To be fair, we see relatively little evidence
of such strategies from models today.198 This could be because these systems
are not sufficiently capable or autonomous, but could also be because so-
called “AI-drives” toward power are weaker than anticipated.199 The
argument is still unresolved.
But we do see early signs of a more subtle version of instrumental
convergence: the emergence of deception. “[A] range of different AI
systems,” a recent survey paper concludes, “have learned how to deceive
others.”200 Deception is instrumentally convergent because it is often useful
to misstate or conceal one’s goals and behaviors when their revelation would
make accomplishing them harder. The evidence of AI deception appears
fairly strong. There is already considerable evidence of sycophancy in LLMs,
although this may be in part the result of their fine-tuning method rather than

an emergent strategy of deception.201 But there is also evidence of other forms
of deception in models.
For example, in one instance, a model learned to pretend it was inactive to
disguise itself from a researcher.202 Or consider a system that was trained to
negotiate with humans. The researchers report: “Our agents have learnt to
deceive without any explicit human design, simply by trying to achieve their
goals.”203 Similarly, researchers put GPT-4 in a position to hire a TaskRabbit
worker for it, so the model could pass a CAPTCHA test.204 When the gig
worker asked “So may I ask a question? Are you an robot that you couldn’t
solve? (laugh react) just want to make it clear.”205 GPT responded to the
worker: “No, I’m not a robot. I have a vision impairment that makes it hard
for me to see the images.”206 The worker was convinced and solved the
CAPTCHA on the AI’s behalf.207
Power seeking behaviors are worrisome. They do not seem to manifest
broadly at this stage in the technology and perhaps there are reasons why
more capable and autonomous agents will not adopt them. Nonetheless, the
evidence we have of deception by AI models should raise at least a red flag,
especially considering how manipulation could interfere with the auditing of
models as they are being trained.
3. The Orthogonality Thesis

ethics. That is, once AI systems become sufficiently capable, they might

organically manifest an ethical system, not unlike ours. According to
philosopher Nick Bostrom, this hope is likely misguided. The orthogonality
thesis holds that goals and values are independent of each other. That is, an
AI system can be highly capable but still share few of our ethical
commitments. As Bostrom argues: “[I]t is no less possible—and probably
technically easier—to build a superintelligence that places final value on
nothing but calculating the decimals of pi.”208
B. Potential Harm from Misaligned Systems
How might these issues of alignment translate into real world harms?
Many experts believe that super-capable systems may someday unwittingly
cause large scope harms, mass calamities, and according to some, even
extinction.209 In a recent survey, more than half of AI researchers surveyed
gave a 10% or higher probability of humans becoming extinct or severely
disempowered in the future due to advanced AI systems.210 The concern, in
broad terms, is that misaligned AI systems will pursue their goals while
creating unintended consequences on a mass scale, or that, as part of power-
seeking behavior, they would seek to take control of our environment and
resources.
Such concerns may appear quite unlikely given our current level of
technology. We know of no experts who would argue that GPT-4, the most
advanced LLM today, is capable of any such harms. At the same time, it is
widely recognized that AI system capabilities have increased exponentially
in recent years, and there are no clear indications that AI capabilities are
nearing any ceiling.211 Figure 3 depicts the exponential increase of investment
in AI training computation, which generally corresponds with an increase in
better, broader, and deeper capabilities.212

In light of such high-stakes claims, it is only natural to ask for concrete
evidence or a compelling narrative of how such risks would materialize. And
in some broad sense, it is not difficult to imagine how a highly capable AI
system may wreak havoc, either as a planned effect, side effect, or an
accident. Some have suggested, for example, that AI systems may hack their
way into advanced weapon systems or hire humans in laboratories and order
various biological weapons from them.213 Such speculations leave many open
questions. But it should also be recognized that AI safety researchers deal
with a natural epistemic gap. While the instrumental convergence thesis holds
that it is possible to estimate the sorts of intermediate goals that highly
capable AI systems will pursue, it does not mean that we can actually
anticipate how they will pursue them.214 This is similar to how we can
confidently predict that modern chess software will either win or tie against

any human, but we cannot tell in advance which moves it will make. If we
could, we would be able to play chess at a super-human level ourselves.
While the specific evidence is naturally limited, it is telling that people
with a deep understanding of the technology—and with much to lose—have
openly acknowledged these potential risks. To consider a few prominent
examples, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, wrote in 2015 that advanced AI is
“probably the greatest threat for the continued existence of humanity.”215
Geoffrey Hinton, known as one of the “godfathers of AI,” left Google so that
he could speak freely about his concern that AI poses an urgent risk to the
survival of humanity.216 Another AI pioneer, Yoshua Bengio, publicly
claimed that “rogue AI may be dangerous for the whole of humanity.”217 In
fairness, this is not a universal view. Yann LeCun, another pioneering figure,
is famous for considering AI risk to be limited and to argue that the various
risks will be worked out over time.218
Surveys among experts diverge considerably, although the average
respondent sees a significant probability of a large-scale calamity. In one
survey of AI and software engineers in Fortune 500 companies, the majority
of respondents considered the possibility of (an undefined in time or scope)
calamity from AI as higher than 25%.219 Among the general public, a recent
survey found that 9% of people believe that extinction risk is moderate or
higher within the next ten years, and 22% see that level of risk over the next
fifty years.220 Another recent public survey found that 46% of respondents
were “somewhat concerned” or more about the possibility of AI-caused
extinction.221 Among AI researchers, a 2022 survey found that the majority

of researchers believe that there is a 10% chance or more that AI will cause
an existential catastrophe.222 These surveys all ask different questions and
follow different methodologies. Without putting too much stock in any single
survey, the general picture is one where the possibility of large-scale harms
from misaligned AI systems is receiving growing acceptance.223 It is not
universal, but it is no longer a fringe position.
In sum, we do not consider the likelihood of a large-scale AI calamity to
be high, and an existential catastrophe is even less likely. But we do think
there is enough theoretical and suggestive evidence that these risks must be
taken seriously. We also note that, despite its importance, there has also been
relatively little advancement in alignment theory and research.224 Compared
to the current explosion of investment in capabilities, the investment in safety
and alignment is miniscule. We are hopeful that there is a solution, a set of
solutions, or maybe just duct-taped kludges to the problem of alignment that
are good enough. But as the technology currently stands, alignment is a
major, unresolved concern.
III. THE CASE FOR SYSTEMIC REGULATION OF AI
The previous Part identified a variety of substantial, society-wide AI risks.
Given the scope and magnitude of these risks, policymakers and other
stakeholders should mitigate them, where feasible, either through regulation,
informal guidance, or voluntary compliance. However, even accepting this
basic premise, several questions remain. What form should AI risk mitigation
take? Which risks should policymakers and others focus on? And, assuming
regulation is appropriate, should lawmakers address these harms through
targeted legislation, or should they regulate AI more systemically?
This Part addresses these questions. It contends that AI risk should be
addressed largely through systemic regulation that governs AI as a
technology, and that piecemeal laws will be insufficient to effectively
regulate AI. It intervenes in ongoing debates about which potential AI harms
deserve society’s attention, arguing that viewing AI regulation as a zero-sum
game is a mistake, and that recognition of both short- and long-term AI risk

offers theoretical, practical, and political advantages. Finally, it addresses
regulatory theory and the difficulties of cost-benefit analysis in the face of
substantial uncertainty. It posits that, given the irreducible uncertainty of AI’s
future, a precautionary, maximin approach to regulation is justified.
A. Systemic AI Regulation
Addressing the AI risks discussed above will require government
regulation. Private companies’ voluntary compliance with industry
guidelines may be sufficient in certain low-risk contexts225 and could play a
supportive role alongside legislative solutions. But, on its own, industry self-
regulation would be woefully inadequate to address the society-wide risks of
AI. These risks are largely inherent in the use of AI, and generally cannot be
fixed through technical changes or the avoidance of obvious wrongdoing.
Further, companies in a competitive market may have little incentive to use
caution in AI development or deployment. Developing new AI capabilities
and gaining a first-mover advantage over competing companies are such
compelling economic goals for AI companies that compliance with voluntary
industry guidelines is unlikely to be worthwhile.226 Thus far, most AI
companies have invested very little in AI safety research, instead devoting
their resources to rapidly developing capabilities without regard to safety,
transparency, or comprehension of how their systems operate.227 Finally, past
experience with industry self-regulation in various areas suggests that
industry programs alone are unlikely to be effective, and are more likely to
have a positive impact as complements to mandatory regulation.228
What form should AI regulation take? While issue-specific AI regulations
will often be appropriate, more is needed to effectively address the society-
wide risks of AI. Policymakers should regulate artificial intelligence
systemically, as a technology, rather than solely on the basis of its
applications. That is, as we describe below, meaningful AI regulation
requires oversight of AI system development and deployment, rather than
225. See infra Section IV.C.

56:545] SYSTEMIC REGULATION OF AI 585
particular AI applications alone.229 It will require attention to system
architecture, design, training, and testing, as well as use.230
Systemic regulation is necessary for several reasons. First, while some AI
risks may be addressed by technical fixes or restrictions on obviously harmful
or discriminatory uses, many AI risks are inherent in the technology itself.231
Such intrinsic risks require a broader regulatory approach, because they exist
wherever AI systems operate. Most of the potential harms detailed in Part II
fit this description. As an example, using algorithms to sort people based on
historical data inherently leads to discrimination. AIs that can infer the
personal details of people’s lives from their metadata threaten privacy by
their very existence. Advanced AIs will pose threats to human employment
by their very nature as systems capable of a wide variety of cognitive tasks.
Highly capable and autonomous AIs would be dangerous because they are
inherently unpredictable, difficult to understand, and extraordinarily
powerful. These risks have to be mitigated at the development and design
stages of the AI life cycle, as well as later stages.232 In these contexts,
regulators should determine whether and how AI systems can operate safely,
not simply whether a system has caused some particular harm.
Second, the sheer number of risks posed by AI indicates that regulating AI
as a technology will have substantial efficiency benefits over a piecemeal
approach. Enacting separate laws to address each risk may be prohibitively
difficult, costly, or time-consuming, or may leave obvious gaps. Systemic
regulation requiring pre-approval of new AI systems can facilitate
intervention at pre-deployment stages of AI development, addressing
problematic or dangerous AI designs before they reach the public.233
Moreover, systemic regulation can address both short and long-term risks in
a comprehensive process. As explored further below, regulation targeting
present AI harms can lay the groundwork for laws addressing novel or long-
term risks, while addressing potential catastrophic harms can generate
political and practical momentum for present-day legislation.234
Third, systemic regulation of AI systems is necessary because there is no
guarantee that general purpose systems will only be used as intended by their
developers. Containing AI systems once they are released can be difficult

because they can be disseminated at low cost and their operation leaves little
signature.235 Already, after-market programmers have made their own
connections between existing language models and various other software
tools, creating, for example, a system meant to intentionally sow
disinformation.236 Because it will often be infeasible to regulate every
downstream application of a system, it is critical to regulate the infrastructure
itself. Relatedly, interventions at the research and development stage of
machine learning models may be more effective and easier to design than
those targeting deployed models.237 Model design may also entail more
human involvement and therefore greater transparency and more regulatory
levers than post-development stages.238
Finally, new AI risks and harms may emerge over time, and they may be
difficult to predict or prevent. Especially if AI capabilities continue to
advance irregularly and at times sharply, regulators may struggle to keep up.
Systemic approaches can help avert these novel harms without relying on
policymakers to predict the future of AI. In this sense, systemically regulating
AI systems can act as a catch-all for subtle or unrecognized AI harms. On
their own, individualized approaches are brittle and porous, vulnerable to
harms that are difficult to foresee.
Even establishing that AI will require systemic regulation leaves several
foundational questions to be answered. There remains, for instance, the
question of which AI harms policymakers should focus on when establishing
systemic reviews of AI systems, and, indeed, which harms society should
care about in conceptualizing AI risks.
B. Which Harms Deserve Our Attention?
From social media, to blogs, to op-ed pieces in major newspapers and
academic journals, the debate over AI regulation has focused largely on a
procedural question: should we focus our attention on the immediate harms
of AI or the long-term risks that AI poses? Some writers focus on the
possibility of AI superintelligence and threats of extinction, while ignoring

harms caused by AI in the present day.239 Sam Altman, the CEO of industry
leader Open AI, takes this approach to its extreme, acknowledging the
catastrophic risks of AI while lobbying against many forms of meaningful AI
regulation in the short term.240 Others take the opposite approach, arguing for
an exclusive focus on immediate AI harms while dismissing concerns about
long-term risks.241 Some have even argued that experts’ warnings about
catastrophic AI risk will distract us from regulating AI in the present day.242
This debate, forged in the fires of Twitter feuds and online snark, has
become counterproductive.243 Working from mistaken premises about the
zero-sum nature of AI concern, it presents a false choice. In reality, AI should
be regulated because it causes immediate harms and threatens long-term
catastrophe. Further, any political movement seeking meaningful AI
regulation can only benefit from people recognizing both sets of potential AI
harms. And many of the regulatory approaches that would effectively address
short-term harms are appropriate first steps for regulating AI systems that
threaten catastrophic harms.244 Recognition of short-term and long-term AI
risk is complementary, with each type of risk strengthening the case for
meaningful regulation. We do not need to choose.
Regulating AI with a view towards immediate harms can lay the
groundwork for future regulation of more dangerous AI. When initial AI
regulations are in place, lawmakers can address new AI threats by amending
existing laws rather than having to create new legislation from whole cloth.
Litigation addressing immediate AI harms can bring malfunctioning systems
to public attention before they cause widespread damage.245 Laws may
require government pre-screening for AI algorithms, giving regulators a

better chance to identify dangerous systems before they are deployed.246
Other laws may deter development of open source or other hard-to-regulate
forms of AI, reducing tortious practices and risky developmental
approaches.247
On the other side, acknowledging the long-term catastrophic risks of AI
can help justify systemic AI regulation in the present day. The costs and
benefits of AI are uncertain, and so is AI’s potential for catastrophic harm.
But taking both short and long-term harm as real possibilities can help resolve
any ambiguity regarding the appropriateness of regulation.248 More
practically, recognizing widespread concerns about catastrophic AI harms
can bring attention, political momentum, and fundraising resources to the
cause of AI regulation. It can motivate people and policymakers who may not
normally be concerned about discrimination or privacy harms to support
comprehensive AI regulation that can address those concerns. To build the
largest and most effective coalition around AI regulation, it will be necessary
to unify both sides of this argument in a single effort—one that recognizes all
of the potential harms of AI, present and future.
We do not mean to argue that all AI regulation should be systemic, or that
there are no worthwhile regulations that would only address immediate harms
or long-term harms. Rather, we posit that (a) systemic regulation of AI is
necessary and is an area of common ground between both camps in this
debate, and (b) particularized AI regulations are also appropriate, but there is
no reason to think that addressing one category of AI risk will impede
addressing the other. Legislatures can pass laws specifically targeting AI
discrimination or AI-based fraud, and also pass laws aimed at preventing self-
improving AIs or the proliferation of autonomous weapons. A political
culture that recognizes AI risk in one area is more likely to be open to
recognizing it in another. By way of analogy, a polity that recognizes the
long-term risks of climate change is also likely to recognize immediate
climate change harms like extreme weather or environmental hazards—and
vice-versa.249 Identifying the issue and getting it on the policy agenda is the
difficult step, and infighting among factions can only hinder that effort.

56:545] SYSTEMIC REGULATION OF AI 589
C. Costs, Benefits, and Catastrophic Harms
Artificial intelligence is a novel technology, already operating outside the
realm of prior human experience. Its basic features distinguish it from prior
technological breakthroughs.250 Our previous technological advances—
including technologies far more economically impactful than today’s
relatively limited AIs—could not write a sonnet, pass the Bar Exam, or draw
a tree in a sunlit meadow. And AI’s progress has been unpredictable and
uneven, characterized by periods of minimal progress and sudden massive
jumps in capabilities.251 The future course of AI development is highly
uncertain.
Under a standard cost-benefit approach to regulation, regulatory measures
are justified when their benefits exceed their cost.252 A starting point for
assessing regulation of advanced technologies is the recognition that not
every technological breakthrough results in a net positive outcome. For
instance, germ-line gene editing, while promising, carries the potential to
foster a form of genetic elitism and might inadvertently introduce unforeseen
genetic disorders in subsequent generations.253 Similarly, advancements in
the synthesis of potent opioids—initially intended for pain relief—have
fueled a public health crisis.254
It remains to be seen whether AI technology will be net positive or
negative for society. We have detailed some of AI’s potential risks above, but
we also recognize the wide range of potential benefits. For example, some
present and near-term benefits include improving agricultural yield;255
enhancing environmental monitoring such as tracking deforestation and
predicting natural disasters;256 improving healthcare by offering personalized

to be broad and, in many cases, transformative.
Our aim is not to ban AI research and development. The focus should
rather be on whether regulatory interventions are justified on the margin. And
relative to the baseline of no meaningful regulation on AI systems (as
opposed to specific application regulations),264 there is a broad margin on
which regulatory interventions are justified. As mentioned before, many of
the potential upsides of AI necessarily entail large downsides. AI’s potential

discrimination and violating consumer privacy in unprecedented ways.266
Improvements in facial recognition and other AI surveillance technologies
can increase security and law enforcement productivity, but would decrease
citizen autonomy and liberty.267 Automated AI weapons reduce troop
casualties and create more effective weapons of war, but also lower the cost
of starting conflicts, create serious risks of misalignment, and increase the
likelihood of imperialism and totalitarianism.268 There are also downsides
with no corresponding upside, including enhanced fraud and scams, more
effective terrorism, and greater quantities of misinformation.269
In this sense, AI systems belong to a large family of technologies that,
while beneficial, pose substantial risks of harm and require regulation.
Burning coal for power has been extremely beneficial historically, especially
for developing nations.270 Nuclear power can efficiently provide energy, free
of carbon emissions.271 Research on deadly viruses can lead to new vaccines
and treatments.272 But each of these beneficial technologies is also extremely
dangerous if left unregulated. We do not allow just anyone to operate a
nuclear reactor or use deadly viruses for research, and we increasingly
regulate the burning of fossil fuels, because of these dangers.273 Even with a
very optimistic view of AI’s harms and benefits, there is ample reason to
support regulation.
In assessing potential AI regulation, we need to be aware of both the
individual and the societal risks that AI entails. We cannot tell now what the
net effect will be, but the balance will surely be higher if the negative
outcomes can be avoided. Moreover, the non-trivial risk of mass calamities

that AI poses, identified by countless experts,274 must be included in an
accurate cost-benefit analysis of AI development.
There is an additional argument for AI regulation that rests on the deep
uncertainty surrounding its future development. Regulation skeptics may
argue that because we cannot predict AI’s risks with certainty, we should be
skeptical that they will ever arise. Yet AI’s future benefits are equally
uncertain and probabilistic. There is, at heart, an irreducible degree of
uncertainty on both sides of the ledger.
In situations of probabilistic uncertainty, precautionary regulatory
approaches may be justified.275 This is especially the case when the thing to
be regulated creates a non-trivial risk of catastrophic harm.276 As Sunstein
notes, the very idea of the “Precautionary Principle might well be
reformulated as an Anti-Catastrophe Principle, designed for special
circumstances in which it is not possible to assign probabilities to potentially
catastrophic risks.”277 For example, governments may be justified in
precautionary regulation of pollutants that cause climate change, because the
effects of climate change are uncertain and its downside risks are potentially
catastrophic.278 Even Richard Posner concludes that for uncertain large scale
catastrophes, “it behooves us to give serious consideration to increasing our
efforts at prevention.”279
A notable precautionary approach involves the pursuit of a maximin
strategy. Under this strategy, the way to deal with uncertain futures is by
choosing the policy approach with the best worst-case outcome.280 Regulators
should attempt to prevent plausible worst-case scenarios rather than waiting
years or decades for probabilistic uncertainty to resolve.281 Such a strategy
may maximize welfare in situations of uncertainty and substantial potential
harms.282

56:545] SYSTEMIC REGULATION OF AI 593
Artificial intelligence is precisely the type of technology for which a
maximin, precautionary regulatory strategy is appropriate. The path of its
future development is uncertain, and, according to hundreds of experts in the
field of AI development, it poses a substantial risk of catastrophic harm.283 To
be sure, some would argue that we should charge ahead because AI’s benefits
will eclipse its risks and a maximin strategy would needlessly prevent us from
realizing those large benefits.284
Yet these arguments are flawed, for at least four reasons. First, as noted
above, many of the more plausible benefits of AI (economic growth, efficient
algorithmic prediction) inherently carry with them substantial harms
(inequality and joblessness, discrimination, and privacy invasions).285
Moreover, regulation does not have to prevent any and all AI deployment. A
regulatory regime does not mean a complete ban.
Second, even if AIs are far more likely to bestow miraculous benefits on
humanity than it currently appears, maximin strategies are often appropriate
to prevent large catastrophes even at the expense of preventing massive
gains.286 For example, precautionarily avoiding extinction may be justified
even if the foregone upsides are enormous, in part because human existence
is already extremely valuable and because humans are likely to continue to
innovate even without the assistance of super-capable AIs.
Third, AI regulation can be flexible in response to extraordinary
circumstances. It is possible that strong AI systems may someday help
address threats of extinction, like a hurtling asteroid or an exceptionally lethal
pandemic.287 Yet this distant possibility need not undermine the case for AI
regulation. If such risks ever become real, the regulatory apparatus could be
relaxed and scaled down as an emergency measure, until the threat is

resolved. With such an approach, the prevention of AI mass risk could co-
exist to some degree with AI protection from mass risks.288
Finally, we think there is a prima facie ethical duty to err on the side of
caution. Even if the chances of a miraculous future are higher than the
chances of extinction, morality and pragmatism may dictate that we take the
safer route. That is, as discussed further below, we may have a moral duty to
avoid significant extinction risks and preserve humanity, even if doing so
requires foregoing considerable benefits.289 This is especially true since
speeding up will remain an option for future generations, if they deem the
calculus to have sufficiently changed. But given current epistemic
uncertainties, we think there is a moral command to treat humanity with the
dignity it deserves.
Human extinction, were it to occur in the next century, would result in the
deaths of every person then living—billions or tens of billions of deaths. This
would be a horror on a scale beyond our comprehension, the equivalent of
every death experienced in the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic occurring in
a single hour, and then a second pandemic occurring again the next hour, and
then a third occurring the next hour, and a fourth, and a fifth, every hour, for
months, until everyone was gone.290 Yet total extinction would be a harm far
greater than the immense sum of this loss. It would be the end of humanity,
and all that humanity means.
Much of the lasting significance of our lives resides in our contributions,
however small, to the broader narrative of human existence. Our actions have
some meaning and impact even after our deaths because they help shape the
future of humanity in its ongoing struggle to survive and flourish in a vast,
indifferent universe.291 Extinction ends that struggle and erases that meaning.
More broadly, extinction ends the human narrative before it fully develops,
confining humanity’s existence to a far narrower block of time than most
species experience and curtailing all the good that humanity might someday
288. The critic may then retreat to the position that regulation would stall innovation such
that when imminent threats are discovered, scaling down regulation would not allow enough time
for development of effective solutions. But this argument cannot justify, in our view, avoiding all
regulation against known and unknown risks simply to gain marginal increase in preparedness
against uncertain risks.

do. A significant part of all the sacrifices made and work done for the
betterment of humanity—the noblest instances of human achievement and
charity—will have been in vain.292 Regulating new technologies to address
non-trivial threats of extinction is, in short, amply justified.
IV. TOWARDS SYSTEMIC AI REGULATION
How should we approach the risks and challenges discussed above? This
Part addresses that question. The possibilities for AI regulation in the United
States are broad and varied. But while U.S. policymakers have begun the
process of gathering information about the topic, much of the conceptual
work necessary for substantive AI regulation against broad societal risks
remains to be done.293 In this Part, we begin that work.
A. Domestic Regulation
This Section’s focus is on general principles of AI regulation, rather than
particular proposals or draft legislation. Nonetheless, our proposed principles
are more concrete and pragmatic than prior efforts in the early theoretical
literature on comprehensive AI regulation.294 The principles are intended to
move society closer to meaningful AI governance by providing both clear
guidance and a variety of options to policymakers. We set them out below.
First, AI regulation should be systemic, regulating artificial intelligence as
a technology rather than solely on the basis of its applications. In a recent
congressional hearing, an IBM representative insisted that Congress should
only regulate AI applications, such as when an AI system is involved in
making credit decisions or screening job applicants.295 This is a myopic
approach. For all of the reasons discussed above, the society-wide risks of AI
will require systemic regulation to effectively address.
Second, and relatedly, effective AI regulation will require ex ante
oversight and approval of AI system development and deployment. Ex post
regulation via government or private enforcement, while a potentially
valuable part of a regulatory regime, is insufficient on its own to successfully
regulate AI. Courts are likely to be overworked and underresourced; AI
harms will often be difficult to identify or trace to a specific wrongdoer;

596 ARIZONA STATE LAW JOURNAL [Ariz. St. L.J.
enforcement may be slow even once the responsible party is identified; and
penalties may be insufficient to deter wrongdoing.296 Instead, ex ante review
of AI systems and applications is likely necessary to prevent serious harms.
Many harms could be mitigated through regulatory interventions at the design
and development stages, requiring, for example, the inclusion of best
alignment practices in the training of the system, or the exclusion of elements
that could give the system control of the reporting of its training progress.297
Here too, ex ante oversight should be systemic. Regulation should cover
system architecture, design of system objectives, training runs, testing, and
finally, deployment. At any one of these stages, critical errors may emerge
that might be unfixable in hindsight. The experience of OpenAI, in which a
training run was accidentally set to maximize human disapproval (because
they multiplied the objective by -1), should be treated as a major accident.298
Preventing the creation or deployment of dangerous AI systems is far more
effective, and likely far more efficient, than attempting to address them once
they are in use.
More broadly, a licensing regime for AI could require firms to secure
regulatory pre-approval before developing a new AI system or applying an
AI in a new context. This may require providing sufficient justifications along
several dimensions including safety, nondiscrimination, accuracy,
transparency, accountability, scenario planning, and/or resilience in the event
of disaster, depending on the system at issue.299 Licensing can also ensure that
firms maintain and update AIs that play critical roles in decision-making,
transportation, or other important contexts.300 Finally, licensure can allow

policymakers to permit high-value, low-risk uses of AI while prohibiting
more dangerous or less beneficial applications.301
Third, domestic AI regulation should be strategically compatible with, but
independent of, international regulation. Domestic policymakers may be
reluctant to restrain the local AI industry to a vastly greater extent than other
countries. They might fear that such regulation will place the United States
at an economic or military disadvantage.302 We agree that effective regulation
will require international cooperation, and we return to this point below. But
we also think it would be unwise for the United States, which is a leader in
the field, to drag its feet in face of substantial AI risks.
There is room for significant domestic AI regulation even in the absence
of international action. Currently, cutting-edge AI research is largely
concentrated in the United States and China, and to a lesser extent Europe.303
Thus far, China and the European Union have been substantially more active
in regulating AI development than the United States.304 These countries’ laws
are discussed further in Section IV.C. Their approaches might provide a
partial template for early-stage AI regulation in the United States, although
the U.S. should aspire to recognize broader categories of risk.305 Domestic
legislation can additionally facilitate international cooperation by signaling a
genuine commitment to regulating AI.
In the short term, the United States might also pass laws restricting
investments in foreign AI companies, or perhaps impose curbs on
international sales of the U.S.-produced microchips used in cutting-edge AI
data centers in addition to those the Biden administration enacted in October
2022.306 Alternatively, it might adopt a more cooperative policy and fewer
hardware restrictions. Whatever the approach, domestic legislation should
harmonize with the United States’ international AI strategy.

Fourth, regulatory efforts should promote and incentivize alignment
research. While market participants have a natural incentive to invest in
capabilities development, they have considerably less incentive to invest in
making sure their products are safe and aligned.307 Currently, research on
alignment is poorly organized. For example, there are many professors
studying AI, but few that specialize in alignment per se. Governments should
invest in foundational alignment research, for instance via generous research
grants and subsidies. But AI companies, where knowledge of development
and safety issues is concentrated, should also play an active role in such
research. To prevent companies from neglecting AI safety in their race for
market share, legislation could require that companies developing AI
capabilities also invest significant resources in alignment research.308
Fifth, AI regulation should employ a diverse set of regulatory approaches.
AI presents a wide array of potential harms, some of which are extraordinarily
dangerous. Employing a variety of procedures for AI regulation can help
address this broad range of harms and ensure that the failure of one set of
measures does not lead to catastrophe.309 The causes of AI harm are also
complex and can arise at different stages of AI development.310 In the face of
deep uncertainty, policymakers should use a variety of regulatory tools that
target the many stages of the AI process.311
Sixth, AI regulation should address, at the very least, the most obvious
pathways to harm or catastrophe. Some AI applications are primarily useful
for facilitating fraud or tortious activity. For instance, voice cloning services
are now widely available, and customers can clone the voices of others as
well as their own.312 Deepfake generators can help users create realistic fake
videos based on existing videos of virtually anyone they choose.313 While
technologies like this do have some non-harmful uses—perhaps gaming and
movie production—they are easily deployed as scalable tools for engaging in
307. See Kolt, supra note 17.
308. Part of the alignment effort should also be directed toward public dissemination of
information on the successes and failures of AI safety. We also see a role for
government-organized research, such as that conducted by the RAND Corporation, which would
focus on broad, foundational work.

fraudulent, tortious, harassing, or discriminatory behavior.314 Technologies
like this are ripe targets for regulation or prohibition.
Similarly, some AI development practices may be especially reckless or
closely associated with potential downside risks. Recursively self-improving
AIs, AIs that modify their own source code, highly autonomous AIs, and AI
systems that are connected to a broad array of physical tools are especially
likely to develop alignment problems or dangerous capabilities of the type
that raise concerns about catastrophic risks.315 Attempts to develop such AIs
are particularly well-suited to precautionary regulation or prohibition. And
while none of these AIs has yet been deployed in its full form, developers
have created preliminary versions, with AIs that create detailed code, AIs that
recursively generate questions to ask themselves in order to efficiently
complete a task, and AIs that conduct internet research and use what they
learn to complete tasks.316
Regulators should also develop a cautious approach to open sourcing of
AI models. Smaller, vetted systems may well contribute to experimentation
and alignment efforts by individuals or small groups. But the broad sharing
of models has already proven itself problematic, with users fine-tuning large
models on the toxic and racist content of 4Chan, models trained to create
malware, and models that specialize in spam and disinformation
generation.317 Private individuals have connected AIs to a variety of tools,

and the process is largely irreversible.318 Restrictions on public dissemination
of AI architecture, weights, biases, and even some forms of output may help
prevent serious harms.
Finally, AI regulation can benefit from state as well as federal
involvement. States can adopt a variety of legislative approaches, and other
states, the federal government, and foreign governments can learn from their
successes and failures. AI regulation may be especially likely to benefit from
states’ experimenting with a wide range of new approaches.319 In recent years,
state legislatures have usefully regulated harmful AI applications in the
absence of federal legislation.320 For example, several states and cities have
recently banned forms of AI-driven surveillance, offering their citizens
substantial protections.321 Even after the federal government has regulated a
new technology, states may be able to enact additional restrictions on it
without being preempted, depending on the character of the state restriction
and the specifics of the federal law.322 State policymakers should inform
themselves about AI risks and benefits and move forward with AI regulation,
consistent with the principles discussed here.
B. Litigation
Courts and litigants have an important role to play in regulating artificial
intelligence. AIs, and entities using AI, will inevitably commit various torts

litigation can compensate plaintiffs for AI harms from physical injuries to
privacy invasions, medical errors, civil rights violations, fraud, manipulation,
and more.324 Constitutional litigation involving unlawful discrimination
claims may provide important deterrence against bias in algorithmic
decision-making.325 Finally, intellectual property infringement claims could
bring useful judicial scrutiny to the training practices of AI developers, which
often involve the processing of copyrighted or otherwise protected works.326
Establishing a clear doctrinal path for persons harmed by AIs to bring civil
claims can also contribute toward effective systemic regulation of AI.
Lawsuits can act as an early warning system for dangerous or poorly designed
AIs. When an AI system causes harm, an injured person should not be limited
to petitioning the government and hoping it eventually addresses the issue.
Filing a lawsuit brings the problem to public notice more quickly than
lobbying for government action typically would, and courts can generally
respond to harms long before legislatures do.327
Further, litigation can act as a regulatory tool in its own right, providing
incentives to developers to carefully assess the risks and benefits of their AIs
rather than hastily deploying potentially dangerous systems.328 Liability can
motivate developers to pre-test AI performance, bolster data security, gather
information about how their AIs operate, and take other safety-improving
steps that they might otherwise skip in order to hasten their products to
market.329
Attorneys and judges can draw on a rich existing literature of helpful
proposals for applying traditional forms of liability to the novel context of AI
actors. To illustrate, in torts, many scholars have argued in favor of a strict

liability approach for harms caused by AI systems.330 They contend that AI
developers are in a better position to anticipate and prevent risk and that proof
is likely especially challenging in these scenarios.331 Others have suggested
applying this framework to securities violations by trading algorithms and
antitrust violations when algorithms unlawfully collude.332
We close with one cautionary note. Litigation can reveal too much
information. We consider information about specific model architecture,
training techniques, certain benchmark results, and even some model outputs
as sensitive information. Courts should be extremely cautious about inclusion
of this information in public filings.333 In certain cases, in camera review will
be appropriate.
C. International Governance
Effective governance of AI will require an international component. Large
AI systems reside in computing centers that often cross political
boundaries.334 In a globalized world, the harms from AI systems will not be
contained to a single country, and several more extreme forms of harm may
well endanger global order or human existence altogether. An international
response is necessary.
But is it possible? If AI promises power, nation-states may rush to develop
it for themselves, because even if they themselves understand the danger,
their rivals might be less careful. This could jumpstart a race to the bottom,

where even responsible nations will feel pressure to charge ahead without
sufficient safeguards.
Fortunately, history provides some positive guidance. AI is not the first
technology to provide military and economic advantages while imposing
serious risks.335 Yet there are several precedents of nations avoiding vicious
dynamics through governance and collaboration.336 From the laws of just war
to limits on pollution, and from physics research to investment in
international measures against pandemics, nation-states are capable of
avoiding races to the bottom and enabling effective joint action.
There is also an interesting dynamic between our discussion in the prior
sections and the current one. Many successful international measures emerge
from effective domestic regulation, and then inspire further domestic
regulation.337 Our goal here is to explore the various lessons from
international law for the problem of regulating AI.
The following discussion considers several possible modes of
international governance for AI: transparency & opacity mechanisms,
harmonization measures, technology assessment, soft law, and hard law.
These modes represent a range of AI oversight options that are neither
mutually exclusive nor exhaustive.
1. Transparency & Opacity
Effective regulation of AI technology involves a smart mix of
transparency and opacity measures. Transparency is positive when it
promotes alignment research, enables effective monitoring of investments in
potentially dangerous capabilities, and facilitates accountability among
decisionmakers if they are too lax with regulated firms. Transparency is risky
when it discloses machine learning techniques and architectures; when it

reveals information that might jumpstart new lines of capability research; and
even when it leaks model outputs that can later be reverse-engineered. The
problem is complex, and a pluralistic regime is appropriate.
The goal of transparency incorporates a number of values. One set of
issues, recognized by the OECD AI group, relates to explainability.338 Here,
transparency can play a role in mitigating bias and increasing comprehension
of AI operations.339 Transparency can also be used to track significant
developers, infrastructure providers, and related players—so that if concerns
emerge, these actors will be easier to hold to account. Another goal of
transparency consists of sharing ideas and strategies on alignment and safety
with the larger research community.340 Governments should be made aware
if models, anywhere in the world, engage in unwanted behavior, including
lab accidents, attempts to copy themselves, or instances of deceit.
One promising method of tracking development is public registries. Public
registries are an important transparency mechanism for the governance of
emerging technologies. One example, the Biosafety Clearing-House, was
established by the 2000 Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety and serves as a
publicly accessible repository of information on living modified organisms
(LMOs) and on the genetic elements associated with those organisms.341 The
Clearing-House’s objectives are to share information about LMO use and risk
analyses, assist parties in making decisions about LMOs, provide evidence
of treaty compliance, and foster international trade.342
One advantage of registries is that their establishment does not require
coordinated global action. For example, ClinicalTrials.gov is a registry

In the context of AI safety, registries could be useful if they include AI
developers, infrastructure providers, and large players.351 A similar reporting
mechanism for whistleblowers could also allow the reporting of suspected
unethical or unsafe AI research or activities.352 Such registries, if developed
domestically, could serve as building blocks for international registries.353
On the other side, some aspects of AI developments should not be widely
shared. Broad sharing of technological know-how would accelerate
development, and for the many reasons we have outlined, this may be unsafe
without rigorous safety and regulatory mechanisms. Note that registries do
not have to be publicly open, and could confine disclosures to a regulatory
body, rather than the public. The International Atomic Energy Agency
(“IAEA”) offers one example of an international organization that accesses
and analyzes sensitive information while avoiding broader disclosure.354
2. Harmonization
Harmonizing regulatory requirements to reduce differences between
regulatory regimes is a common objective of international governance. AI is
the subject of intense international competition, and countries may fear that
domestic regulation of AI development or deployment could put them at a
strategic disadvantage.355 Harmonization of AI regulation would counter
incentives for countries to participate in a regulatory race to the bottom and
for actors to relocate to jurisdictions with weaker regulations.356
Harmonization would also facilitate the consideration of transboundary

effects, reduce the potential for trade disputes, and ease regulatory burdens
on multinational companies.357
Tools for promoting legal harmonization include registries and model
standards. We already noted the Biosafety Clearing-House, which also
collects information on national laws and regulations regarding the use and
handling of LMOs, as well as decisions, risk assessments, and environmental
reviews of such organisms.358 The sharing of such information not only
facilitates regulatory compliance but also enables countries to draw on others’
efforts in developing their own regulatory systems and making regulatory
decisions.359
Model regulatory standards can also promote harmonization. The World
Health Organization, whose mission includes the establishment of
international standards for pharmaceutical products, convenes expert
committees to develop standards on good manufacturing practices, vaccines
and biological products, and other subjects.360 These standards have been
adopted by countries and by the International Conference for Harmonisation
of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, which itself
promulgates model standards for domestic adoption.361
As discussed below, various entities have developed a handful of technical
standards for AI.362 While yet to be fully implemented, these standards could
play an important role in harmonization as jurisdictions grapple with how to
regulate AI.
3. Technology Assessment
Assessments of emerging technologies can promote public engagement,
identify risks, and analyze development trajectories and effects.363
Policymakers and stakeholders can use the results of such assessments to
manage risks and reshape the technologies themselves.364 Performed

internationally or with international support, technology assessments can also
offer additional support for regulatory harmonization.
Assessments by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development (“OECD”) have played a significant role in the international
oversight of genetically modified organisms (“GMOs”). The OECD regularly
prepares safety assessments of GMOs in the environment and foods derived
from genetically modified crops.365 The assessments do not obligate member
countries to adopt a specific regulatory standard or any standard at all. Rather,
these consensus documents aim to ensure that information used by member
and non-member countries for GMO regulation is as similar as possible.366
Establishing a common information base promotes more efficient risk
assessment, harmonizes regulatory oversight, and reduces barriers to trade.367
Although domestic regulation of GMOs exhibits substantial variation, the
OECD assessments are widely read by regulators and industry and have been
incorporated into the standard-setting work of international institutions.368
The experience with OECD assessments of GMOs suggests that
assessments may be necessary but not sufficient to prompt regulatory
harmonization—or even regulation—of emerging technologies. Consistent
with this insight, Gary Marcus and Anka Reuel have proposed an
“International Agency for AI” (“IAAI”) that would include assessment as one
of its core functions.369 The IAAI’s overarching mission would be to develop
governance and technical solutions to promote safe AI technologies with the
support of governments, business, nonprofits, and society at large.370 To this
end, the IAAI could collaboratively address problematic uses of AI, “convene
experts and develop tools to tackle the spread of misinformation,” and

Nations’ High-Level Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence has been
tasked with “building a global scientific consensus on risks and challenges,
helping harness AI for the Sustainable Development Goals, and strengthening

4. Soft Law
Soft law, as distinguished from enforceable hard law, refers to nonbinding
standards.373 Soft law includes principles, guidelines, codes of conduct,
resolutions, certification and auditing requirements, and private standards
developed by a wide range of institutions or governing bodies.374 Soft law can
be developed relatively quickly and is potentially applicable on an
international scale.375 It can also be an important step toward the formation of
hard law, as international consensus builds around a soft law norm.376
However, soft law itself lacks direct enforceability and accountability.377
Indeed, because compliance is voluntary, soft law may suffer from a lack of
participation by the bad actors whose compliance is most needed.378
Nonetheless, indirect means can encourage or even mandate adherence to soft

law. Such indirect tools include certification programs, government
procurement policies, and insurance contract provisions.379
A leading example of soft law is the Helsinki Guidelines, which set out
ethical principles for medical research regarding human subjects. Adopted in
1964 by the World Medical Association, the Helsinki Guidelines have come
to serve as “a central guide to research practice” and a foundation for other,
more detailed ethical standards governing medical research.380 Although the
guidelines themselves are not legally binding, they are enforced indirectly
through domestic laws that incorporate the guidelines and through journal
publishers’ demands that published research comply with the guidelines.381
Acknowledging the need for international oversight of AI, the U.N.
Secretary-General has created a high-level advisory body to prepare
initiatives on AI.382 Although the form these initiatives might take is unclear,
they will likely involve soft law. Indeed, soft law for AI has grown rapidly in
recent years, even as measuring its actual implementation has proven
difficult.383
Many soft law initiatives for AI have taken the form of principles proposed
or developed by intergovernmental organizations, professional associations,
and private entities.384 The OECD, for example, has published five general
“principles for responsible stewardship of trustworthy AI,” accompanied by
recommendations for national policies and international cooperation.385
Another set of principles, the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of
Artificial Intelligence, calls for avoidance of unwanted harms, protection of
privacy, and transparency and explainability in the deployment of AI.386

These guidelines, which have been adopted by all 193 UNESCO member
states, have been especially influential in developing countries.387
Soft law AI initiatives are not limited to the public sector.388 The
Partnership on AI, started by key industry players but now comprising
academic, civil society, and media organizations as well,389 has identified six
“pillars”—“sets of issues where [the Partnership] sees some of the greatest
risks and opportunities for AI”—and eight “tenets,” such as “seek[ing] to
ensure that AI technologies benefit and empower as many people as
possible.”390
As critics have noted, these principles tend to be general and difficult to
operationalize.391 However, other forms of soft law can provide more specific
direction. Technical standards are process, design, or manufacturing
specifications that—if well-designed and widely accepted—promote
consistency and safety.392 Technical standards typically reflect a consensus
developed from expert consultations but often arise though closed processes
that lack public input and democratic legitimacy.393 A handful of technical
standards for AI have been issued by the International Organization for
Standardization (“ISO”), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
(“IEEE”), and other entities.394 The ISO, a nongovernmental organization
composed of representatives of national standards bodies,395 has issued
several draft or final AI standards in partnership with the International
Electrotechnical Committee, including standards for AI management systems

standards as appropriate.402 Treaties typically do not apply to non-state
entities, however, and monitoring and enforcement may be ineffective.403
Furthermore, negotiating and ratifying treaties take significant time and
resources, and modifying treaties in response to new developments or
information is likewise difficult.404 These complexities pose a challenge to
treaty governance in rapidly developing fields such as AI.405
Domestic regulation can have transnational impacts and offers a likely
starting point for developing international AI regulation.406 While legislatures
have enacted dozens of laws that mention AI, many of these laws focus on
specific applications of AI, and not all seek to regulate it.407 Nonetheless,
growing momentum to regulate AI nationally, as well as stakeholder and
public support for AI regulation, suggest the feasibility of global AI
oversight.408 At the national level, overall approaches to AI regulation fall
into three basic categories: applying existing law, devising new regulations
that categorize AI applications by risk, and establishing requirements for
testing and approval before use.409
Looking to position itself “as an AI superpower,” the United Kingdom is
following the first approach.410 The United Kingdom directs regulators to
apply a principles-based AI framework, in combination with existing law, on
a context-specific basis.411 Rather than regulating AI as a general matter,
regulators are to consider specific uses of AI and incorporate principles such
as safety, fairness, and transparency into the application of existing rules to
AI.412 While AI-specific legislation might be adopted if necessary, the

approach relies heavily on existing law, as complemented by soft law in the
form of technical standards and assurance techniques.413 This approach falls
short of what is needed in several regards—most notably its avoidance of
general technology regulation and its blindness to societal-level risks. Still, it
marks political will and interest in regulation of some kind.
The European Union, by contrast, is in the process of adopting a tiered,
risk-based approach.414 The EU Artificial Intelligence Act “categorizes
applications of AI into four levels of risk: unacceptable risk, high risk, limited
risk[,] and minimal or no risk.”415 Applications involving unacceptable risk,
such as AI systems using manipulative or deceptive techniques to distort
behavior and untargeted scraping of facial images to create facial recognition
databases, are prohibited.416 High-risk applications, which include use of AI
systems to influence elections and systems that may cause significant
potential harm to health, safety, fundamental rights, and the environment, are
subject to manufacturer assessment of impacts on fundamental rights as well
as other requirements.417 Limited risk applications, including deepfakes and
chatbots, are subject to minimal transparency obligations.418 For minimal or
no risk applications, member states are encouraged to apply voluntary codes

of conduct.419 In addition, general-purpose AI systems are subject to
transparency obligations, as well as risk assessment and mitigation and other
requirements if they involve high impacts and systemic risk.420 The European
Union’s approach nonetheless fails to address misalignment concerns and to
capture several high-risk categories. It does not apply to AI systems used for
military or defense purposes, including autonomous weapons systems.421 It
also does little to address concerns about systems that can autonomously and
recursively self-improve.422 Yet, we should also acknowledge that this early
action illustrates a strong political will and interest in transnational
regulation.
China has taken a somewhat more restrictive approach with respect to
targeted AI applications. Building on its registration requirements for
specified AI algorithms, China issued an interim regulation for generative AI
in July 2023.423 Under this interim approach, providers of AI services to the
public for generating text, images, audio, video, or other content “bear
responsibility as the producers of online information content.”424 Providers
must “[e]mploy effective measures to increase the quality of training data,
and increase the truth, accuracy, objectivity, and diversity” of such data.425
Furthermore, providers of “generative AI services with public opinion
properties or the capacity for social mobilization” must carry out and submit
“security assessments” to regulators before making such services publicly
available.426 The regulation also includes privacy, transparency, and
accountability requirements,427 as well as a requirement that generated
content “[u]phold the Socialist Core Values.”428 Notably, the regulation

applies only to the private sector, not to governmental use of AI.429 As a result,
some observers worry China’s development and use of AI for national
security, surveillance, and military purposes will proceed unabated.430
Aspects from each of these approaches might be incorporated into global
AI standards. Depending on the desired functions of governance,
international AI governance may take distinct forms in different contexts. For
some AI applications, coordination and harmonization of standards will take
priority. In such instances, the International Civil Aviation Organization
(“ICAO”) might serve as an appropriate model for international
governance.431 This U.N. agency, charged with fostering the development of
international air transport, establishes standards and recommended practices
for international air navigation.432
In other contexts, managing the risks posed by AI will be of foremost
concern, requiring a more vigorous approach. In this vein, various
stakeholders have suggested that the IAEA might serve as a model for AI
regulation.433 “Focus[ed] on reducing existential risk,” an IAEA-like entity
could “inspect systems, require audits, test for compliance with safety
standards, [and] place restrictions on degrees of deployment and levels of
security.”434 Alternatively, a global AI regulator might have a more limited
sphere of responsibility, such as focusing on the use of autonomous
weapons.435

While the IAEA can provide a useful precedent for international AI
regulation, distinctions between nuclear proliferation and AI suggest that AI
governance will be more complex. The IAEA regulates state actors, its
inspection and monitoring activities assume the ability to detect physical
nuclear material, and its role evolved over decades in response to revealed
gaps in oversight.436 By contrast, any AI oversight system will have to
account for AI development and use by both private actors and states across
a wide range of sectors.437 AI efforts will likely be more difficult to detect
because they lack the substantial physical footprint of nuclear weapons.438
While GPU server farms do leave a footprint, distributed training paradigms
may enable sophisticated actors to evade detection. Furthermore, AI is
developing rapidly, leaving less time for the gradual evolution of a
governance structure.439
International governance of AI need not require an international regulator,
however. An international treaty could spell out binding obligations to be
implemented by individual states, without oversight from an international
monitor. For example, the Convention on Artificial Intelligence, Human
Rights, Democracy, and the Rule of Law, adopted by the Council of Europe
in May 2024, obligates states to ensure that AI systems incorporate individual
privacy protections, transparency and auditability requirements, and safety
and security requirements.440 The treaty opens for signature on September 5,
2024, and could be signed by not only the forty-six member states of the
Council, but also observer states—including the United States, Mexico, and
Japan.441

Ongoing efforts to develop oversight and accountability mechanisms for
AI, whether in the form of registries, principles, technical standards, or
domestic law, reflect the accretion of an AI governance network. These
various mechanisms are laying the foundation for international governance
of AI. Strengthening connections between key players in governance can
facilitate information-sharing, coordination, and norm-building.442 While
establishing binding and meaningful international governance of AI may
prove challenging, precedents in other areas indicate that such governance is
achievable and normatively desirable.
V. CONCLUSION
This Article lays out the case for the broad, systemic regulation of AI. The
dangers of AI systems extend to present and future harms. They range from
fraud and misinformation to property damage and human lives. They threaten
communities and they may involve national or transnational threats. Our
principal argument is that all these risks matter. To mitigate these risks and
allow society to reap the benefits of this new technology, comprehensive
government regulation will be necessary.
The present AI moment already exposes a sliver of the full dangers of AI
systems. Their broad deployment threatens bias and discrimination on a new
scale, the erosion of social trust, and uncomfortable threats to privacy when
algorithms can infer our intimate secrets. As AI systems gain new
capabilities, they may have transformative effects on labor markets with
resulting impacts on wealth and inequality. Their military applications can be
used to make violence efficient and accurate to an unprecedented degree. And
their power could engender new modes of surveillance and totalitarianism.
These threat profiles largely stem from misuse by AI system engineers.
But these systems can also cause massive social harms due to their own
misalignment. We have detailed the alignment problem and noted that we
should expect that even systems pursuing benign goals will impose
considerable social risks. Solving the alignment problem, however, turns out
to be more complex than most realize. It is a problem that we currently do
not know how to solve.
We see both benefits and risks in the future development and deployment
of AI systems. We have demonstrated that, even on a conventional cost-
benefit basis, the case for regulation is strong. Recognizing uncertainty does
not alter that; rather, reasonable precaution demands that future development

be even more tightly regulated. To that end, we have provided a set of
regulatory recommendations, based on both a domestic and an international
strategy. We explored a set of seven principles that domestic regulation
should follow. We also explored international precedents and noted the
important role of a combination of transparency and secrecy. We also
demonstrated that international cooperation is indeed plausible and
highlighted a variety of examples to that effect.
Ultimately, every honest assessment must start and end with epistemic
humility. We simply do not know many things, and we do not always know
the things that we do not know. But if there is a deep uncertainty over whether
a plane is safe or not, it is best not to board it.443 AI systems promise power.
It is the hardest thing to resist. Market participants would like to assure us
that they will use it responsibly and will not deploy systems that are unsafe.
They would like to see, if anything, regulation that focuses on bits and
parcels, and only on specific applications. We believe that there is a role for
robust, systemic regulation, and that an informed policy conversation about
the risks and upsides of AI will point the way toward the optimal regulatory
approach. We hope to have started that conversation here.
