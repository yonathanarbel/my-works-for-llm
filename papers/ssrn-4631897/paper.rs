## TL;DR ≤100 words
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that new technologies are enabling "nano contracts"—extremely small-scale agreements governing ephemeral, minuscule-value interactions previously outside formal law. While nano contracts can unlock new opportunities and efficiencies, they also carry significant risks, challenge effective regulation, could collapse private law boundaries, and reveal scale's neglected role in private law.

## Section Summaries ≤120 words each

*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that new contracting trends and technologies are facilitating "nano contracts," extremely small-scale agreements for ephemeral, low-value interactions previously outside formal law. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while these nano contracts offer new opportunities, they also carry significant risks, challenge effective regulation, and could ultimately collapse private law boundaries, revealing scale's neglected role in private law.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes to introduce the concept of nano contracts, exploring their fundamental aspects including platforms, protocols, and necessary legal technology. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the paper then delves into specific applications like nano lines, nano leases, nano gigs, and nano accidents, examining the legal policy implications for each.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that, drawing an analogy to Richard Feynman's call to explore nanotechnology, current technological trends demonstrate a dramatic miniaturization of contract scale. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that this changed, smaller scale of contracts has profound implications that his article will explore.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that scale transformations in contracts carry profound legal and social implications, holding both promise and peril if the legal response is inattentive. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that recent technological trends like digitization, XaaS models, and AI agents are creating the infrastructure for "nano contracts," characterized by near-zero latency and extremely low transaction costs.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nano contracts are digitally negotiated, automated, near-instantaneous agreements for very small-scale peer-to-peer transactions involving tiny values or fragmented rights, reducing intermediaries. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that these nano contracts challenge classical contract law by blurring distinctions between contractual relationships and spot exchanges, as traditional assumptions about parties, negotiation, and value may not hold.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the small scale of emerging "nano contracts" introduces novel legal classification questions, potentially making current regulatory frameworks fragile. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nano contracts are distinct from smart contracts because their primary ambition is to solve contract formation for very small transactions, often using P2P digital protocols.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nano contracts hold potential for profound social and economic change by transforming common interactions governed by social norms, like queuing, into formal market transactions. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while this presents opportunities for new markets, it also raises concerns about excessive commodification and economic disparities, similar to evaluations of the gig economy.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his article examines the intersection of scale, contracts, and technology, engaging with discussions on the gig economy, platform regulation, and equitable benefit distribution from innovation. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the article introduces "nano contracts" via a thought experiment, like a four-way stop, to show their potential, dangers, and implications for markets in goods previously unalienable due to negotiation costs.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that current traffic laws mechanistically allocate the right-of-way using a "first in first out" principle, often ignoring crucial factors like need or urgency. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while a system prioritizing based on individual circumstances is desirable and efficient, designing it presents significant practical challenges.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nano contracts, facilitated by an application, could manage traffic right-of-way through automated, near-instantaneous auctions where drivers bid small amounts based on stated urgency. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that this system aims to allocate priority based on actual needs, potentially making traffic flow more efficiently, fairly, and safely.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while nano contracts offer potential to solve inefficiencies like optimizing traffic flow, they also raise significant ethical and legal concerns regarding wealth disparity, commodification, and breaches. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that to counter skepticism, he will show how scale transformations in contracts historically led to profound social outcomes and how platforms and protocols can address practical challenges.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while platforms introduce market power risks, alternatives like protocols, though harder to develop, can facilitate transactions and make nano contracts feasible. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contract history, viewed through scale, reveals an evolution of legal technology supporting increasingly smaller, more flexible transactions, from massive corporate deals to small gig contracts.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that society has historically moved from rigid, status-defined roles towards more modular, voluntary transactions facilitated by contract development. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that this profound shift continues, with Jonathan Yovel's examination of J.S. Bach's life illustrating an individual's transition from a status-based existence.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that J.S. Bach's move to a contract-based position exemplifies the societal shift from status to contract, a change he embraced for its freedom. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the gig economy, enabled by platforms like Uber and Airbnb, is a more recent transformative innovation reshaping work, travel, and business.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the gig economy, via internet infrastructure, profoundly impacted society by downscaling traditional contracts into short, small-scale "micro contracts" for services like single rides. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that this downscaling represents a continuous historical arc—from status to contract to gigs—where reduced transactional block size has consistently transformed the transactional world.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nano contracts use digital infrastructure for automated, real-time, P2P bargaining between strangers, employing various forms like auctions, though their multi-dimensional small scale makes precise definition difficult. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that these contracts are a natural continuation of trends like digitization, with the "XaaS" (Everything as a Service) model being a significant, often overlooked, enabler.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the "Everything-as-a-Service" (XaaS) model signifies a market shift towards "nanonization of products," disaggregating product bundles into specific, on-demand functions like Trringo's farming equipment services. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that this trend shows market need for unbundled goods; nano contracts differ from XaaS by facilitating more P2P transactions with less intermediation.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that smart contracts primarily aim to streamline contract execution, often using blockchain for trust between unknown parties. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that this focus on execution fundamentally distinguishes smart contracts from nano contracts, which are mainly tools for low-cost, near-instantaneous contract formation.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that for nano contracts to facilitate real-time digital P2P transactions, triangulation costs (locating providers, settling prices, agreeing on terms) must be exceedingly small due to minimal transactional surplus. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contract formation must also be streamlined, as costly procedures would deter parties from using nano contracts.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that for nano contracts to function, unlike macro contracts, assent expression must have minimal friction and cost, as slight delays would render these rapid transactions impossible. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nano contracting also demands speedy, secure, inexpensive payment processing, alongside available, trustworthy dispute resolution and effective enforcement.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nano contracts, despite being fragile to transactional costs, can learn from gig economy solutions like platforms and reputation systems to address practical concerns. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that to overcome "triangulation costs," solutions include platform-based marketplaces or protocols allowing direct communication between transacting parties.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the challenge of nano contract formation can be addressed through advance consent and automated negotiations, enabling real-time agreements with minimal latency or cost. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while some argue automated systems lack agency for contractual assent, this is contestable as modern contract law accommodates proxy and digital assent.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Bama School of Law writes that the validity of nano contracts, relying on preestablished digital assent, isn't undermined by the medium itself, given a verifiable pedigree of that assent. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while traditional payment systems are too expensive for micropayments, fintech developments and practices like platform-side accumulation offer solutions.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nano contracts face payment challenges due to inefficient infrastructure, requiring solutions like platform payment accumulation or alternative financial tools, highlighting payment inefficiency as a source of platform market power. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that traditional dispute resolution is ill-suited for small-stake contracts, leading the gig economy to use reputation systems and in-house adjudication.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that platforms like Uber use reputation systems, with mutual user reviews, to promote good behavior and accountability without lawsuits. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that for significant transgressions, platforms employ internal dispute resolution, often issuing quick refunds, though this exposes them to class actions and regulatory interventions.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that even in small "nano contracts," like four-way stop interactions, the legal system can intervene to assign fault if a breach causes an accident, providing dispute resolution. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that interpreting digital contracts uses existing common law tools, and as transaction scale decreases, complexity and disagreement potential fall superlinearly.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the cost of small claims lawsuits, often $15-$85, can make legal action for "nano contracts" economically unviable. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that for "micro contracts," this can be addressed through platform dispute resolution, reputation systems, precautionary payments, and escrow services, including blockchain-managed ones.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that after explaining nano contracts' institutional features and policy support, his analysis will explore their transformation of key law areas, focusing on queue regulation. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that lines represent a painful public policy problem when demand outstrips capacity, causing frustration, conflict, and time costs.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Americans waste billions of dollars and significant time in lines, typically unregulated and governed by social norms that can cause conflict. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that lines operate on a "willingness-to-wait" principle, which can lead to queues expanding until waiting time consumes much of the sought resource's value.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while "first in line" is common but crude, some services offer priority by need or social status. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that online lines, despite seeming convenient, don't increase service capacity and can worsen allocation by removing physical waiting costs, attracting more users including scalpers and bots.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that inefficient line systems persist due to the "verification problem"—authentically managing urgent need claims without significant costs, errors, or gaming. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that even if verification is solved, a "grasshopper problem" arises concerning individuals who don't plan ahead versus prepared "ants."
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that current triage systems, like letting late passengers skip airport security, can create "grasshopper problems" by rewarding reckless planning at the expense of diligent planners. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nano contracts offer a solution by enabling parties to negotiate and pay for line positions, verifying urgency through willingness-to-pay and disincentivizing poor planning.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nano contracts allow peer-to-peer payments among line participants for priority, ensuring compensation for yielding place goes to others in the queue, not a third party. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that this contrasts with commercialized lines where revenue benefits firms or intermediaries, potentially disincentivizing line reduction.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nano contracts do not necessarily require money, citing Northwestern's Kellogg School where students use token points to bid for courses. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that to explore why time markets are uncommon, he discusses Professor Oberholzer-Gee's experiment showing increased monetary offers raised willingness to yield a line spot.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that social norms about favors can deter accepting payment to cut in line, as shown by an experiment where higher offers improved responses but repeated attempts met hostility. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nano contracts can overcome these frictions by normalizing requests for priority, creating opportunities for mutually beneficial time trades.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nano-contracts, as a market-based queuing solution, risk "market creep" into socially-governed areas, raising distributive, efficiency, political, and ethical concerns. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that such commodification faces criticism, notably from Michael Sandel, who argues for the "ethic of the queue," where waiting can better reflect need than willingness-to-pay.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Michael Sandel's "queue ethic" argument is unpersuasive, questioning its application when a market economy allocates most goods via prices and lines are often downstream of this system. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that commitment to the queue ethic is puzzling given normalized paid priority, and evidence suggests willingness-to-pay, not wait, strongly signals value.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the assumption that 'Willingness to Wait' (WtW) is inherently more progressive than 'Willingness to Pay' (WtP) is incorrect, as free time is unequally distributed, often disadvantaging the poor. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that he argues nano contracts can often be more progressive, as reliance on WtW can be regressive for individuals like poor tenants who lack time.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nano contracts can improve line-waiting by offering choices to retain place, idle for compensation, or pay for priority, and proposes tradable priority tokens for vulnerable parties. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while commoditizing lines for private goods may be acceptable, a "queue ethic" should apply to publicly provisioned goods like voting, where market allocation is faulty.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that society has decided certain goods, like votes or emergency medical access, should be allocated outside markets, and commoditizing them via trading can undermine equality and justice. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nano contracts could facilitate such undesirable trading, potentially eroding social norms, thus policymakers must identify and regulate these contexts.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while nano contracts offer social utility, an efficiency concern is potential 'cloggers' intentionally creating delays to collect payments from those in a rush. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that this 'clogger' problem is likely limited because cloggers bear real costs, and emergent issues could be addressed through indifference or 'keyhole solutions' like bans.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a vast amount of personal and commercial resources, like cars and office spaces, remain significantly underutilized, representing sheer waste. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nano contracts, specifically nano leases, offer a way to utilize this idle capacity, exemplified by services sharing underutilized broadband internet.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that services like Helium for IoT connectivity and Olio for food sharing illustrate "nano leases'" potential to monetize underutilized capacity in everyday transactions. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that this extends to clothes rentals and proposes nano contracts as an alternative for disputes over drone aerial passage rights.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nano leases could enable individuals to rent out diverse underutilized personal assets, from books to computing power, if transaction costs become sufficiently low. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that despite caveats like physical limits and dispute costs, the gig economy's success suggests many will share assets once transaction costs are significantly reduced.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nano leases offer lessors benefits by monetizing underutilized assets for income and improved household liquidity. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that for lessees, nano leases reduce ownership necessity by providing on-demand access and specialization, aligning with Product-as-a-Service models.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nano contracts facilitate peer-to-peer leasing for better resource utilization, allowing access to services like laundry or pet location without owning underlying assets. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that this emerging nano leasing model challenges traditional ownership, suggesting a potential evolution from property-based systems towards contract-based resource access.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nano contracts challenge private ownership, raising concerns about whether temporary, leased interactions diminish autonomy and the developmental link between individuals and property. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that prevalent nano leasing might also undermine the "endowment effect," altering how people value property as it becomes more like trade goods.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the shift from private ownership, seen with Airbnb, can unexpectedly align with anti-consumerist philosophies critiquing private property and overconsumption. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nano contracts, by enabling shared use and reducing waste, offer a "life-as-a-service" model that mitigates environmental impact and disrupts traditional property notions.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that property is best seen as an architectural system for asset use, not separable rights, and emerging "nano contracts" with low transaction costs enable fine-tuned governance mechanisms. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that these nano leases challenge traditional contract law, particularly UCC Articles 2 (Sales) and 2A (Leases), as small-scale leases become hard to distinguish from licenses.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nano contracts for excess capacity, like commercializing underutilized broadband, raise distributional policy concerns as this could increase overall usage and service costs, creating unfair cross-subsidies. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that despite these concerns, nano contracting can also reduce net capacity usage and improve welfare, as studies on Uber suggest.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while nano leasing can significantly increase asset utilization, producers might contractually prevent such leases, similar to restricting electronic device repairs. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that this shift from property to nano contracts also raises philosophical questions about autonomy, legal questions about contract classification, and distributional concerns.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nano contracts could enable "nano jobs," allowing individuals to use idle time for very short, casual paid tasks like data labeling, building on the gig economy model. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that this could tap a large, underutilized labor market, offering low-commitment income and potentially progressive widespread opportunities for small paid tasks.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while a common critique is that the gig economy exploits regulatory arbitrage, recent research suggests this may be overstated and platforms can provide significant worker wage benefits. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a major concern is its potential to transform employment law, designed for worker protection, into mere contractual agreements, creating a less safeguarded worker class.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nano contracts, with work measured in minutes, will make traditional employment protections like vacation and minimum wage exceedingly difficult, exacerbating gig worker classification challenges. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that policy responses could include expanding the social safety net or focusing on nano employment as an anti-poverty mechanism.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nano contracts in employment offer unmatched flexibility and potential, allowing individuals shunned by traditional labor markets to find income by utilizing extra time. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nano work also raises concerns like eroding self-space by expanding work into leisure, and making employment law challenges harder, potentially undermining worker advocacy.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nano contracts can expand consensual agreements, thereby converting significant areas of tort law, which typically governs nonconsensual accidents, into contract law. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that this is shown by a train operator using nano contracts for a real-time auction with farmers to determine the least costly direction for spark emission, versus problematic post-harm tort assessments.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nano contracts can achieve socially desirable outcomes by enabling "split-second auctions" where parties agree to direct inevitable harm to the least valuable asset, minimizing damage more effectively than retrospective tort law. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that these may also offer distributional advantages, allowing victims more recovery than under tort law, which acts as a backstop.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nano contracts can efficiently minimize harm and provide agreeable accident compensation, illustrated by a farmer potentially earning more from train-emitted sparks than crops if accidents are frequent, incentivizing prevention. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while such contracts allow rethinking accident alienability for property damage, caution is warranted for bodily harm due to deep moral norms.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his article aims to explore significant implications of trends like digitization and tokenization leading to smaller "nano" transactions, foreseeing both liberating markets and societal "traffic jams." Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while nano contracts offer transformative potential, they also present unsettling ethical dilemmas, necessitating further scholarly analysis to guide their future."#;

**论文：ssrn-4631897，作者：Yonathan Arbel教授**

## TL;DR (内容概要 ≤100词)
阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授认为，新技术正催生“纳米合同”——这是一种规模极小的协议，用于管理以往游离于正式法律之外的、短暂且价值微不足道的互动。尽管纳米合同能够释放新的机遇并提高效率，但它们也带来了重大风险，对有效监管构成挑战，可能瓦解私法边界，并揭示了规模在私法中被忽视的作用。

## 各章节摘要 (≤120词/节)

*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，合同的规模转变具有深远的法律和社会影响，如果法律应对不力，则既有机遇也有风险。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，近期的技术趋势，如数字化、“X即服务”(XaaS)模式和人工智能代理，正在为“纳米合同”构建基础设施，其特点是近乎零延迟和极低的交易成本。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，纳米合同是通过数字方式协商、自动化、近乎即时达成的协议，适用于价值微小或权利碎片化的极小规模点对点交易，并减少了中介机构。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，这些纳米合同对经典合同法构成了挑战，因为它们模糊了合同关系与即时交换之间的区别，传统的关于当事人、谈判和价值的假设可能不再成立。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，新兴“纳米合同”的小规模特性带来了新的法律分类问题，可能使现有的监管框架变得脆弱。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，纳米合同不同于智能合约，因为其主要目标是解决极小额交易的合同订立问题，通常使用点对点数字协议。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，纳米合同通过将以往由社会规范管理的常见互动（如排队）转变为正式的市场交易，具有带来深刻社会和经济变革的潜力。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，尽管这为新市场带来了机遇，但也引发了对过度商品化和经济差距的担忧，类似于对零工经济的评估。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，其文章审视了规模、合同与技术之间的交叉点，并参与了关于零工经济、平台监管以及创新成果公平分配的讨论。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，该文章通过一个思想实验（如四向停车路口）引入“纳米合同”的概念，以展示其潜力、风险以及对因谈判成本过高而以往无法转让的商品市场所产生的影响。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，现行交通法规采用“先到先得”原则机械地分配通行权，往往忽略了需求或紧急程度等关键因素。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，尽管一个基于个体情况优先排序的系统是可取且高效的，但其设计面临重大的实践挑战。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，在应用程序的辅助下，纳米合同可以通过自动化、近乎即时的拍卖来管理交通通行权，驾驶员可根据声称的紧急程度进行小额竞价。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，该系统旨在根据实际需求分配优先权，从而可能使交通流更高效、公平和安全。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，尽管纳米合同具有解决诸如优化交通流等低效问题的潜力，但它们也引发了关于贫富差距、商品化和违约等重大的伦理和法律关切。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，为消除质疑，他将展示合同规模的转变在历史上如何导致深远的社会成果，以及平台和协议如何能够应对实践挑战。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，尽管平台带来了市场势力风险，但协议等替代方案虽然开发难度更大，却能促进交易并使纳米合同变得可行。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，从规模视角审视合同历史，可以揭示法律技术的演进过程，即支持越来越小、越来越灵活的交易，从大型企业交易到小型零工合同。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，历史上，社会已从僵化的、由身份定义的角色转变为由合同促成的、更具模块化和自愿性的交易。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，这一深刻转变仍在继续，Jonathan Yovel对J.S.巴赫一生的研究便阐释了个体从基于身份的生存状态向此转变的过程。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，J.S.巴赫转向基于合同的职位，体现了社会从身份到合同的转变，他因其自由而欣然接受了这一变化。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，由优步(Uber)和爱彼迎(Airbnb)等平台赋能的零工经济，是近期一项重塑工作、旅行和商业模式的变革性创新。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，零工经济通过互联网基础设施深刻影响了社会，将传统合同缩小为针对单次乘车等服务的短期、小规模“微合同”。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，这种规模的缩小代表了一个持续的历史轨迹——从身份到合同再到零工——其中交易单位规模的减小持续地改变着交易世界。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，纳米合同利用数字基础设施在陌生人之间进行自动化的、实时的点对点议价，采用拍卖等多种形式，但其多维度的小规模特性使得精确定义变得困难。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，这些合同是数字化等趋势的自然延续，“X即服务”(XaaS)模式是一个重要但常被忽视的推动因素。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，“一切即服务”(XaaS)模式标志着市场向“产品纳米化”的转变，将产品组合分解为特定的按需功能，例如Trringo公司的农用设备服务。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，这一趋势表明市场对非捆绑商品的需求；纳米合同与XaaS的不同之处在于，它促进了更多中介化程度更低的点对点交易。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，智能合约主要旨在简化合同执行，通常使用区块链来建立未知方之间的信任。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，这种对执行的关注从根本上将智能合约与纳米合同区分开来，后者主要是用于低成本、近乎即时达成合同的工具。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，为使纳米合同能够促进实时的数字点对点交易，由于交易盈余极小，交易撮合成本（指寻找供应方、确定价格和商定条款的成本）必须极低。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，合同订立过程也必须简化，因为成本高昂的程序会阻止各方使用纳米合同。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，与宏观合同不同，纳米合同要有效运作，其同意的表达必须具有最小的摩擦和成本，因为轻微的延迟都会使这些快速交易无法实现。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，纳米签约还需要快速、安全、廉价的支付处理，以及可用的、值得信赖的争议解决机制和有效的执行。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，纳米合同尽管易受交易成本影响，但可以借鉴零工经济的解决方案，如平台和声誉系统，来解决实际问题。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，为克服“交易撮合成本”，解决方案包括基于平台的市场或允许交易方直接通信的协议。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，纳米合同订立的挑战可以通过事先同意和自动化协商来解决，从而能够以最小的延迟或成本实时达成协议。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，尽管一些人认为自动化系统缺乏达成合同合意的能动性，但这是有争议的，因为现代合同法承认代理和数字形式的合意。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，只要预先建立的数字合意具有可验证的来源，纳米合同的有效性并不会因其媒介本身而受损。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，虽然传统支付系统对于微支付而言成本过高，但金融科技的发展和平台方累积支付等实践提供了解决方案。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，由于基础设施效率低下，纳米合同面临支付挑战，需要平台支付累积或替代性金融工具等解决方案，这凸显了支付效率低下是平台市场势力的一个来源。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，传统的争议解决机制不适用于小额合同，这使得零工经济转而使用声誉系统和内部裁决。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，像优步这样的平台使用声誉系统，通过用户相互评价来促进良好行为和问责制，而无需诉诸法律。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，对于重大违规行为，平台采用内部争议解决机制，通常会快速退款，尽管这使它们面临集体诉讼和监管干预的风险。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，即使在诸如四向停车路口互动这样的小型“纳米合同”中，如果违约导致事故，法律体系也可以介入判定过错，从而提供争议解决方案。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，解释数字合同可使用现有的普通法工具，并且随着交易规模的减小，复杂性和分歧的可能性会超线性地下降。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，小额索赔诉讼的成本通常在15至85美元之间，这可能使得针对“纳米合同”的法律行动在经济上不可行。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，对于“微合同”，这可以通过平台争议解决、声誉系统、预防性付款和第三方托管服务（包括区块链管理的服务）来解决。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，在解释了纳米合同的制度特征和政策支持之后，他的分析将探讨它们如何改变关键法律领域，重点关注排队监管。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，当需求超过供给能力时，排队就成了一个棘手的公共政策问题，会导致挫败感、冲突和时间成本。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，美国人在排队上浪费了数十亿美元和大量时间，排队通常不受监管，而是由可能引发冲突的社会规范所支配。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，排队遵循“等待意愿”原则，这可能导致队列延长，直到等待时间消耗掉所寻求资源的大部分价值。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，虽然“先到先得”很常见但较为粗略，但一些服务会根据需求或社会地位提供优先权。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，在线排队尽管看起来方便，但并不能增加服务容量，反而可能因消除了实体等待成本而吸引更多用户（包括黄牛和机器人），从而恶化分配状况。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，低效的排队系统之所以持续存在，是由于“验证问题”——即如何在没有显著成本、错误或被滥用的情况下，真实地管理紧急需求声明。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，即使解决了验证问题，也会出现关于不提前计划的个人（“蚱蜢”）与有准备的“蚂蚁”之间的“蚱蜢问题”。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，现行的分流系统，如允许迟到的乘客优先通过机场安检，可能会通过奖励鲁莽计划者而损害勤勉计划者的利益，从而造成“蚱蜢问题”。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，纳米合同提供了一种解决方案，它使各方能够协商并支付排队位置的费用，通过支付意愿来验证紧急程度，并抑制不良计划行为。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，纳米合同允许排队参与者之间为优先权进行点对点支付，确保让出位置的补偿归于队列中的其他人，而非第三方。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，这与商业化排队形成对比，后者中产生的收入使公司或中介受益，可能抑制其减少排队的动机。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，纳米合同未必需要金钱，他引用了西北大学凯洛格商学院的例子，那里的学生使用积分代币竞拍课程。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，为了探究为何时间市场不常见，他讨论了Oberholzer-Gee教授的实验，该实验表明提高金钱报价会增加人们让出排队位置的意愿。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，关于人情的社会规范可能会阻止人们接受付费插队，一项实验表明，尽管提高报价能改善回应，但反复尝试会遭遇敌意。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，纳米合同可以通过使优先权请求常态化来克服这些摩擦，为互利的时间交易创造机会。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，作为一种基于市场的排队解决方案，纳米合同存在“市场蔓延”到社会规范管理领域的风险，引发了分配、效率、政治和伦理方面的关切。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，这种商品化受到批评，特别是来自迈克尔·桑德尔的批评，他主张“排队伦理”，认为等待有时比支付意愿更能反映需求。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，迈克尔·桑德尔的“排队伦理”论点缺乏说服力，他质疑在一个大多数商品通过价格分配，且排队往往是该系统下游产物的市场经济中，该伦理的适用性。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，鉴于付费优先已常态化，对排队伦理的执着令人费解，且有证据表明，支付意愿而非等待意愿，更能强烈地反映价值。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，“等待意愿”(WtW)本质上比“支付意愿”(WtP)更具进步性的假设是错误的，因为空闲时间的分配不均，往往使穷人处于不利地位。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，他认为纳米合同通常可以更具进步性，因为依赖等待意愿对于像缺乏时间的贫困租户这样的个体而言可能是倒退的。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，纳米合同可以通过提供保留位置、有偿等待或付费优先的选择来改善排队等候，并提议为弱势群体提供可交易的优先权代币。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，虽然将私人商品的排队商品化或许可以接受，但对于像投票这样的公共供给品，市场分配存在缺陷，“排队伦理”应适用。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，社会已经决定某些物品，如选票或紧急医疗服务，应在市场之外进行分配，通过交易将其商品化会破坏平等和正义。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，纳米合同可能助长此类不受欢迎的交易，从而可能侵蚀社会规范，因此政策制定者必须识别并监管这些情境。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，尽管纳米合同具有社会效用，但一个效率方面的担忧是潜在的“拥堵制造者”可能故意制造延迟，以便从急于通过的人那里收取费用。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，这个“拥堵制造者”问题可能影响有限，因为拥堵制造者自身也承担实际成本，并且新出现的问题可以通过不予理睬或诸如禁令之类的“小范围精准干预措施”来解决。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，大量的个人和商业资源，如汽车和办公空间，仍未得到充分利用，这代表着纯粹的浪费。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，纳米合同，特别是纳米租赁，提供了一种利用这种闲置能力的方式，例如共享未充分利用的宽带互联网服务就是例证。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，诸如用于物联网连接的Helium和用于食物共享的Olio等服务，展示了“纳米租赁”在日常交易中将未充分利用的容量货币化的潜力。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，这延伸到服装租赁，并提议将纳米合同作为解决无人机空中通行权争议的一种替代方案。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，如果交易成本足够低，纳米租赁可以使个人出租各种未充分利用的个人资产，从书籍到计算能力。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，尽管存在物理限制和争议成本等警示，但零工经济的成功表明，一旦交易成本显著降低，许多人会共享资产。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，纳米租赁通过将未充分利用的资产货币化以获取收入并改善家庭流动性，从而为出租人带来益处。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，对于承租人而言，纳米租赁通过提供按需访问和专业化服务，减少了拥有资产的必要性，这与“产品即服务”模式相符。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，纳米合同促进点对点租赁以更好地利用资源，允许人们在不拥有基础资产的情况下获得洗衣或宠物定位等服务。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，这种新兴的纳米租赁模式挑战了传统所有权，表明可能从基于财产的系统向基于合同的资源获取方式演变。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，纳米合同对私有制构成挑战，引发了关于临时性的租赁互动是否会削弱自主性以及个体与财产之间发展联系的担忧。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，普遍的纳米租赁还可能削弱“禀赋效应”，改变人们对财产的估值方式，因为财产变得更像交易商品。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，正如爱彼迎(Airbnb)所体现的，从私有制转变的趋势，可能出乎意料地与批判私有财产和过度消费的反消费主义哲学相一致。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，纳米合同通过实现共享使用和减少浪费，提供了一种“生活即服务”模式，减轻了环境影响并颠覆了传统的财产观念。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，财产最好被视为一种资产使用的结构体系，而非可分割的权利，而新兴的具有低交易成本的“纳米合同”使得精细调整的治理机制成为可能。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，这些纳米租赁挑战了传统合同法，特别是《统一商法典》第2条（销售）和第2A条（租赁），因为小规模租赁变得难以与许可区分。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，针对过剩容量的纳米合同，如将未充分利用的宽带商业化，引发了分配政策方面的担忧，因为这可能增加总体使用量和服务成本，造成不公平的交叉补贴。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，尽管存在这些担忧，但正如对优步(Uber)的研究表明，纳米签约也可以减少净容量使用并改善福利。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，虽然纳米租赁可以显著提高资产利用率，但生产商可能会通过合同阻止此类租赁，类似于限制电子设备的维修。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，这种从财产到纳米合同的转变也引发了关于自主性的哲学问题、关于合同分类的法律问题以及分配方面的担忧。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，纳米合同可以催生“纳米工作”，允许个人利用闲暇时间从事极短期的、非正式的付费任务，如数据标注，这是在零工经济模式基础上的发展。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，这可以开发一个巨大的、未被充分利用的劳动力市场，提供低门槛的收入，并可能为小型付费任务带来具有进步意义的广泛机会。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，虽然一个普遍的批评是零工经济利用了监管套利，但最近的研究表明这可能被夸大了，平台可以为工人提供显著的工资福利。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，一个主要的担忧是它可能将旨在保护工人的雇佣法转变为纯粹的合同协议，从而创造出一个保障较少的工人阶层。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，在纳米合同中，工作以分钟衡量，这将使得假期和最低工资等传统雇佣保护措施极难实施，从而加剧了零工工人分类的挑战。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，政策应对措施可能包括扩大社会保障体系或将纳米就业作为一种反贫困机制来重点关注。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，纳米合同在就业方面提供了无与伦比的灵活性和潜力，允许被传统劳动力市场排斥的个人通过利用额外时间找到收入来源。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，纳米工作也引发了担忧，例如通过将工作扩展到休闲时间而侵蚀个人空间，以及使雇佣法方面的挑战更加困难，可能削弱工人权益的维护。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，纳米合同可以扩展合意协议的范围，从而将通常管辖非合意事故的侵权法的大量领域转变为合同法。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，一个例子可以说明这一点：火车运营商利用纳米合同与农民进行实时拍卖，以确定火花排放成本最低的方向，这与事后进行有问题的侵权评估形成对比。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，纳米合同可以通过实现“瞬时拍卖”来达到社会期望的结果，在拍卖中各方同意将不可避免的损害导向价值最低的资产，从而比回顾性的侵权法更有效地将损害降至最低。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，这些合同还可能提供分配上的优势，使受害者比在侵权法下（侵权法作为后备保障）获得更多的赔偿。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，纳米合同可以有效地最小化损害并提供可接受的事故赔偿，例如，如果事故频繁发生，农民从火车排放的火花中获得的收益可能超过作物收益，从而激励其采取预防措施。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，尽管此类合同允许重新思考财产损害事故的可转让性，但由于涉及深层道德规范，对人身伤害应持谨慎态度。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，其文章旨在探讨数字化和通证化等趋势导致交易规模更小的“纳米”级交易所带来的重大影响，预见到这既会解放市场，也可能造成社会性的“交通拥堵”。阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，尽管纳米合同具有变革潜力，但也带来了令人不安的伦理困境，需要进一步的学术分析来指导其未来发展。"#;

## TL;DR

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that new technologies are enabling "nano contracts"—extremely small-scale agreements governing ephemeral, minuscule-value interactions previously outside formal law. While nano contracts can unlock new opportunities and efficiencies, they also carry significant risks, challenge effective regulation, could collapse private law boundaries, and reveal scale's neglected role in private law.

Yonathan A. Arbel
Contracts are falling in scale. New contracting trends and technologies
facilitate the formation of smaller scale contracts that have extremely short
duration, stakes, and scope. These nano contracts embody ephemeral
interactions of minuscule value interactions that were so far outside the
law and away from explicit markets, governed only by social norms.
The rise of nano contracts can unlock new transaction types,
opportunities to build wealth, and reduce dependence on private ownership.
Yet they also carry important risks, and their small scale makes them difficult
to effectively regulate. At the limit, nano contracts collapse private law
boundaries between property, torts, and contract, and would require a
rethinking of the basic private law categories. This Article offers the first
comprehensive study of these Lilliputian agreements, examining their
potential while attending to questions of enforceability, market creep, and
disparate impact. The analysis reveals the essential, if neglected, role of scale
in private law, and how it can and should inform jurisprudence and policy.

In the 1959 annual meeting of the American Physical Society,

mischievous grin, Feynman sought to persuade a room of physicists that
they should turn their gaze from the heavens above to the molecular level
below. It is at the bottom the smallest scale of atomic interactions that
we can find grand opportunities for innovation. In his inimitable style, he

deep legal implications. What I will strive to show throughout is that scale
transformations do more than change the commercial aspect of transactions,
they also carry the seed of social transformation. Drawing on examples of
past scale transformations in contracts, it will become clear that a fall in
contract scale can lead to broad social, political, and material changes. But
while the march of technology is likely inevitable, the social response is not.
Some of the changes carry great promise, promoting greater autonomy,
choice, and prosperity. Yet, if the legal response is inattentive, these changes
can also imperil social values, marginalized communities, and freedom. The
Article works to illuminate both the promise and peril that lie at the bottom
of contracts.7
To motivate the analysis, consider the joint effect of some recent
colinear trends in contracting practices: digitization of the contractual
forms;8 cultural normalization of digital deals; the dispensation with wet
signatures; the thundering rise of Everything-as-a- XaaS
contracts; 9 the tokenization and fractionalization of ownership; the
ascendance of high-frequency trading (itself often a form of nano
contracting);10 the increasing ability of AI agents to
effectively process natural language, negotiate, and transact;11 and the
persistent high-speed Internet connectivity of geolocated individuals and
objects.12 What ties these trends together is their creation of infrastructure
that allows for the formation of agreements at near-zero latency and at
asymptotically low transaction costs. These trends set the ground for a new
breed of contract: nano contracts.
7 As emphasized throughout, the graveyards are full of failed predictions about the future of
contracts, chief among them being GRANT GILMORE, THE DEATH OF CONTRACT (1974). Part V
offers a homage to this wonderful, if mistaken, prediction by hazarding an opposite future. See

2023] 𝑛𝐾 5
Nano contracts are digitally negotiated agreements that employ
automated and near-instantaneous bargaining processes in multiparty peer-
to-peer ( p2p ) transactions. What makes them nano is their scale. They
cover transactions that last a few seconds; transfer cents, milles, and even
smaller fractions of the dollar;13 or transfer slivers and fragments of the
bundle of rights of ownership. Their p2p character reduces the need for
intermediation, and thus allows parties to transact with each other without
necessarily involving firms or platforms in the middle.
Two preliminary questions immediately present themselves. Is there
anything truly new about these agreements if they are simply smaller scale
contracts, and are these fleeting agreements even properly called contracts?
On reflection, these two questions respond to each other. Classical concepts
of definite position and momentum break down at the quantum scale. So
do contracts. In classical contracts, the most basic distinction is between
pure exchange relationships and contractual ones.14 This classification is
made based on certain assumptions about the identity of the parties, their
capacity, the negotiation process, the values exchanged, and so on. Because
these assumptions no longer necessarily hold, it is increasingly difficult to
classify nano contracts as either contracts or spot exchange. The blurring of
these two categories is what makes nano contracts so interesting to study.15
This point is best illustrated through a recent example. The rise of the
gig economy brought its own scale transformation.16 Before the gig
economy, short transportation agreements were mediated by the state
through licensing and certification schemes.17 Uber and Lyft changed that
by arguably disintermediating the relationship.18 Much of the recent lawfare
around these platforms is about the classification of the agreements they
facilitate. Is Uber an employer? What does it owe its drivers? Uber proposed
that it only matches passengers to independent contractors for pay, and that
this exchange does not amount to a contract, hoping to skirt the
13 Section 20 of the Coinage Act of 1792 defined the mille as a fraction of a cent. See

contractual relationship between them and the platforms, for precisely the
opposite reasons. The new technological form blurred traditional
boundaries, resulting in novel and socially important questions about the
scope of contracts.
Such legal encounters teach the general lesson that in law, scale has a
quality of its own. Yet, as noted by Lee Fennell, scholars and policymakers
powerful new (and sometimes
fraught) legal configurations. 20 Nano contracts will bring their own
questions about legal classification. Are nano agreements that let a party use
for a brief stop, for example, best understood as leases,
licenses, or something else?21 Should
right of way be enforced as contracts? The small scale of nano contracts
brings with it new questions which we have not yet considered, making our
regulatory framework quite fragile to these developments.
The final preliminary question is how nano contracts might differ
from other forms of digital contracts. The answer, which admittedly sounds
like it comes from a college application, is focus and ambition. Unlike smart
contracts, which are primarily tools of contract governance, the focus and
ambition of nano contracts is to solve the problem of contract formation.22
It is frustratingly difficult to create systems that allow for the creation of very
small transactions, because even small frictions can overwhelm the value of
truly small agreements.23 Nano contracts address these issues using p2p
digital protocols. Another possible distinction is that nano contracting
technology does not require the blockchain or cryptography, although it
could incorporate them if desired.24 This marks nano contracts as a discrete
form of transactional technology aimed at addressing the negotiation and
formation bottleneck.

Nano contracts contain within them the germ of profound social and
economic change. This germ, however, needs to be scrutinized before it
spreads. A common saying in startup culture is move fast and break
things. 25 This Article is interested not only in asking what will break, but
also whose things are likely to break. Disruptive technologies, in a process of
Schumpeterian creative destruction, often upend social and economic
structures.26 Nano contracts disrupt a large domain of common interactions
that, due to their minuscule size and stakes, were left outside the market.
Interactions such as waiting in the line at the deli are today mostly governed
by social norms. Nano contracts will allow parties to turn these interactions
into transactions. To market enthusiasts, this presents an opportunity to
open new markets and create new forms of wealth. To market skeptics, nano
contracting is yet another instance of market creep, 27 which would
inevitably lead to excessive commodification, economic exploitation, and
material disparities. After the gig and sharing economy revolution, the
import of these questions is timely and salient. Uber, Airbnb, Taskrabbit,
and other sharing economy platforms created newfound sources of wealth
for some people on the margins of society.28 But many other workers
experienced financial losses and unemployment, neighborhoods saw
property prices rise, and hotels faced a shrinking market.29
This type of analysis requires consideration of future trends and
concrete use cases. To weigh these considerations, this Article offers a variety
of examples from diverse domains, some already deployed, others fast
approaching, and yet others more imaginative. The nature of such
projections is inherently uncertain and so a certain degree of suspension of

It also presses us to think carefully about the proper limits of markets in

what needs to be true for them to work, and what we can
learn about their organization from their constraints. From this trunk, four

Four cars approach an intersection. The laws of physics prevent all
cars from occupying the intersection at the same time. As they slow down,
we witness the emergence of a valuable, but rivalrous right: the right of way.
How should society allocate this scarce resource? Admittedly, this is an odd-
sounding question. We do not normally think of intersections and driving
as problems of allocating scarce rights, but rather of obedience to the laws
of traffic. Still, at a fundamental level, much of what traffic laws do is
coordinate and allocate movement rights. And we want traffic laws do that
job well.
Ideally, scarce rights should be allocated to those who need or value
them the most. But traffic laws adopt a mechanistic allocation rule: first in
first out ( FIFO ).33 A blind allocation of resources based on chance may fit
some social settings, but this allocation loses luster when applied to actual
road design. As a system, this distribution ignores many relevant moral facts
such as need, urgency, or desert. Indeed, we encounter a common
frustration every time we idle at an empty stop sign.
Realizing all of this, various actors have made tweaks around the edges.
Urban designers try to adjust traffic light timing such that the odds of
finding a green light will favor those on the more occupied road.34
Legislators set rules such that when a real emergency erupts, ambulances and
the police can usurp the right of way,35 and, in some parts of the country,
the rule is further tweaked by social norms of courtesy, although those are
not uniformly observed.36 Still, none of these tweaks do much to remedy the
basic issue: antecedence is not an efficient or desirable method of allocating
resources.3738
The problem is that it is hard to come up with a better system that
increases fairness or efficiency. We have all been in situations where we were
either late to an important appointment and needed some priority, or early
with extra time to give. Most of us would see the utility if not outright
sanity of a system where we could get priority when in a rush, and give
priority when time is on our side. After all, to give our place in traffic to the
car carrying a person in the throes of labor is a matter of basic decency. But

such a system is unworkable at scale. It is impossible to individually check
each driver level of urgency. Even if it were possible to inquire, why trust
the answer? Nobody likes to sit in traffic.
Nano contracts offer a solution to this age-old problem. A nano
contract application installed on every drivers car, phone, or autonomous
driving system, could allocate the right of way through automated bargains.
Before beginning their journey, drivers enter their destination and their level
of urgency, allowing the app to determine how much they value priority. As
drivers approach an intersection, a silent auction is held, with drivers
bidding in increments of pennies or in tokens for the right to pass through
the intersection. The driver who wins the auction receives the right of way,
and the apps seamlessly exchange payments between them in the
background. These negotiations are near-instantaneous and contain
vanishingly low transaction costs. This process then repeats for those who
come later as they automatically negotiate their place in line, receiving and
sending nano payments as needed. For example, Brandon who left late to
his meeting with a wedding photographer but paid his way to arrive on time
is now $3.10 poorer, but much happier. Nicole, who had a relaxing
afternoon ahead of her, leisur
collecting $4.20 in fees along the way. She brings them both a cup of coffee.
Before addressing any issues, let us first stop and appreciate the
achievement of this system. These Lilliputian agreements offer a robust
solution to a vexing problem. As a system, nano contracts ensure that drivers
needs, rather than chance or order of arrival, allocate the right of way. Close
analysis will show that the system is also fairer than the status quo and offers
people a greater degree of control over their lives.39 And because the system
can run on priority tokens, rather than money, we can achieve all these
efficiency gains while promoting equity and access.40 Relative to our static
system today, nano contracts offer a fluid dynamic. Traffic flows.
While the four-way stop may sound like a small, isolated example, it
is not. In the United States alone, there are approximately 411 billion car
trips taken each day41 through a total of 330,000 traffic lights.42 If even a
fraction of those trips were governed by nano contracts, the potential
benefits would be enormous. Traffic is far less stressful if, instead of fighting
to keep your place, you make a couple of bucks by letting people pass you.
And traffic is far safer if, even when people find themselves in a rush, they
have a safer alternative to speeding that also ensures they arrive on time. If

we can minimize idling time because priority cars do not need to come to a
full stop, we can also reduce fuel consumption and noxious emissions.
This stylized example illustrates the potential that nano contracts can
unlock. Hopefully, it also sparks a sense of curiosity. If nano contracts can
solve these rote invisible inefficiencies, what other inefficiencies are currently
hidden? What else can we solve with nano contracts?
Our example is also structured to elicit ethical and legal concerns.
Applied without care, the use of nano contracts can result in priority given
to wealthier parties.43 Would nano contracting force poor drivers to treat
every four-way intersection like an endless red light? Would they create a
new source of income for some people or simply commodify yet another
area of life? And then what happens in the nano contract world to the social
norm of giving a friendly wave and letting another person pass before you?
The commercialization and commodification of previously market-free
areas may have a corrosive effect on social norms.44 Or what happens if
someone breaches their nano contract and lunges into a busy intersection?
These issues are real, as are the potential benefits. The goal of the legal system
is to anticipate these concerns and develop appropriate legal and regulatory
frameworks to ensure that when nano contracts are deployed, they are
implemented in a responsible and ethical manner.

How much room is there at the bottom, and can we even get there?
This Part discusses these two forms of skepticism. The skeptic

are unlike a new form of a leveraged buyout or some innovation in futures
contracts. Those are the truly important, innovative transactions. Nano
contracts are small potatoes by definition. Do they deserve much attention?

in contracts, the skeptic is not only unprepared for the future of contracts,
but also for their past. Examining the history of contracts from the
perspective of scale, this Section demonstrates how every scale
transformation was associated with profound and unpredictable social
outcomes. Scale, we remind ourselves, has a quality of its own.

solve these practical concerns. Platforms have great utility, but they also
introduce market power. The alternative is protocols, which can also
facilitate transactions without such risks, although they are harder to develop
and maintain. But limitations notwithstanding, these alternatives render
nano contracts feasible.
A. Scale and Contract Evolution
The future impact of smaller transaction scale is not easy to predict.
Fortunately, it is easier to predict the past than the future. Let us consider,
then, key points from contracts history as they bear on the question at hand.
To be sure, the story of contract past is not a simple one. These legal
agreements reflect a complex web of social, political, and economic forces,
each vying for influence.45 What helps us see through this tangled web is
thinking about contracts along a much simpler dimension: scale. As
presently argued, over time the Anglo-American legal system has developed
legal technology that supports transactions that are increasingly smaller and
more flexible, allowing for more complex and varied interactions and social
arrangements. This shift led to the paradoxical result that we see the
simultaneous emergence of record-setting multi-billion transactions among
firms and five-dollar contracts for gigs, among other fleeting engagements.46
Take the move from status to contract. Under the manorial system,
people were bound by all-encompassing legal arrangements known as
status.47 Status arrangements dictated nearly every aspect of the lives of the
people living in the system and left little room for individual choices. These

A caveat is in order: I confine myself to the Anglo-American common law world, although various
parts of the analysis would apply to the civil law world and possibly beyond.
46 The technological key is transactional modularity. On the relevance of smaller
transactional blocks to handling complexity, see, for example, Henry Smith, Modularity in

stringent sociolegal arrangements defined an individual as a serf, villein,
vassal, and later indentured servant or peon.48
These rigid structures of status were bound to crumble. As Henry
Maine famously observed, the social pressures pent up, [T]he movement of
the progressive societies has hitherto been a movement from [s]tatus to
[c]ontract 49 Over time, the old forms of status were stripped down to
shorter, more modular transactions that were terminable and (warts and all)
voluntary.50 Contract technology then allowed people to enter new forms of
transactions including employment contracts, lease agreements, bailments,
and warranties.51 None of these new forms of transactions emerged at a
defined point in history; rather, they represent a protracted and uneven
process where smaller scale transaction types slowly gained judicial, social,
and political recognition.52
The transition from large scale status to the smaller units of
contract has had a profound impact on society that continues to shape the
way that people and businesses interact.53 It can be difficult for a modern

56 After many troubles, Bach was finally able to leave for Leipzig,
where he became the celebrated musical director of the Thomasschule.57
There, Bach was able to put his status-laden legacy behind him and sign his
first significant formal contract.58 It was then
contract. 59 He may have, in fact, spoken contract too eloquently, as he soon
found himself engaging in acrimonious negotiations and legal disputes with
his new counterparties at the City Council.60 Thus
not a singularly sanguine story of redemption and empowerment. His letters
portray a record of grievances and disappointments by a person who was, to
put it with outmost respect, a real nudnik.61
Still, even if Bach may not have always been thrilled with the new
responsibilities and challenges of his contract position, he ultimately
embraced the freedom and flexibility that it offered. Most importantly, he
never went back. His experience is a synecdoche of the larger societal shift
from status to contract, as millions of people around the world left feudal
systems and entered a new era of economic and social interactions based on
(comparatively) voluntary agreements. 62 Today, every market-based
economy in the world relies on contracts as a central tool of resource
allocation. From employment contracts and leases to warranties and
bailments, we see in all of those smaller scale transactions how the shift from
status to contract has irreversibly redefined business and individual
interactions.

engagement. And indeed, the gig economy downscaled contracts further and
made them less lumpy in scope, duration, and stakes.68 Uber transformed
hiring a personal driver into a single-ride deal; Fiverr converted general
contracting agreements into a twenty-minute gig; and Airbnb reshaped
private-residence subleases into a one-night proposition. By comparison,
these traditional, plain vanilla contracts appear as macro contracts relative to
the micro contract of gig engagements.
To be sure, gigs were not a new concept when these companies first
emerged. And the gig economy did not introduce any breathtaking doctrinal
innovations. Rather, what is notable about the gig economy .
The advent of internet infrastructure has made it possible, for the first time,
to build large-scale marketplaces for small transactions, gigs, and other
limited-term engagements. And just like the move from status to contract,
we again see how smaller arrangements facilitated macro transformations.
unfairly disrupts the character of neighborhoods, and leads to the
exploitation of foreign and domestic workers.69 At the same time, the gig
economy brought with it enormous benefits, enabling people to work on
their own terms and earn a living in ways that were previously impossible.
Between these two tensions, one conclusion is indisputable: the downscaling
of transactions has had a profound effect on the lives of people around the
globe.
This short historical tour offers a clear response to the skeptic.
Independently of any doctrinal or conceptual revolution, contract scale has
always had a transformative effect on the transactional world. From status
to contract and from contract to gig, nano contracts represent a general arc
in the history of contracts. This history entails continuous downscaling of
transactional blocks to profound social effect. Of course, for nano
contracts to fulfill this potential, they must be workable. The next Section
moves to consider a systemic view of nano contracts from an engineering-
economic perspective, revealing in the process the role of legal structures.

B. Nano Contracts as a Technology
Nano contracts use digital infrastructure to facilitate the automated,
real-time, p2p bargaining processes between strangers. Such technology can
wield different forms. For example, in the four-way stop example, a nano
contract app conducted an auction to determine which driver gets the right
of way.70 But this is just one bundle of features for the implementation of
nano contracts. In some cases, nano contracts may use fixed prices rather
than auctions, and in others, they may facilitate exchanges based on barter,
reputation, or even tokens.
While n allows them to fit many use cases,
this feature also makes nano contracts difficult to define.71 Boundary setting
is made more difficult because scale is not one-dimensional. Rather, scale
covers transactional duration, transactional stakes, and the scope of rights
transacted. And there may even be some conflict between these dimensions;
a contract for leasing goods for a few seconds may still fetch a high value, as
we know from the pervasive high-frequency trading industry. These
challenges notwithstanding, the examples provided in Parts IV to VII will
cement some idea of the core and periphery of this concept.
Nano contracts arise from the natural continuation of the existing
trends noted above, including the proliferation and normalization of
digitized agreements, the growing digitization of goods and services, and the
emergence of persistent connectivity at lower latency of geolocated
individuals and objects. 72 These mutually reinforcing trends enable,
technologically, legally, and culturally, the ability to form p2p contracts in
real time at near-zero latency and at vanishingly low transaction costs. While
each of these trends is worthy of full treatment, I focus on one recent trend
overlooked by contracts scholars that lend special credibility to the
emergence of nano contracts: the rise of the XaaS contracting model.
In the days of yore, people bought products from sellers and services
from service providers. So central was the distinction that it was deemed
fitting to construct an entire body of law that deals with one rather than the
other73 and then test neophyte lawyers on it. In recent years, a new model
transitioning erstwhile products into services has started taking over,
commonly abbreviated by the aaS suffix74. In the past, consumers would
buy software like Microsoft Word, and leave the store with a box with a hard
copy of the code. Today, consumers are only subscribers to an ever-shifting

piece of code.75 We now have software as a service (Monday and Microsoft
Office 365), infrastructure as a service (Amazon Web Services and Microsoft
Azure), platform as a service (Google App Engine and Heroku), payment as
a service (Square and Dwolla), and a dozen others.76 One market report
estimates that in 2023, the software-as-a-service market alone will be valued
at 195 billion dollars.77
A recent comprehensive study of the XaaS model has identified several
market philosophy changes that the concept embodies.78 Among these is
what the authors perhaps not coincidently call nanonization of
products.79 By this, the authors refer to the growing trend to disaggregate
product bundles to the specific functions that the end user cares about.
Farming as a service is an especially apt example. While 45% of the Indian
workforce is engaged in agriculture, tractors are quite rare, averaging only
one per village.80 Trringo is one of a few platforms that offer farmers
individual standalone services such as tractors, reapers, cultivators, and tillers
that the farmer can access by simply tapping an app or calling a call center.81
This allows farmers an alternative to ownership, to pay only for the specific
fragment of ownership if and when it is needed.
The advent of the XaaS model represents the growing n
of contracts and products. It demonstrates the market need for unbundled
goods, the utility of specialization, the importance of small-scale
transactions, and the robustness of the supporting technological
infrastructure. One chief difference is that in nano contracts, parties will
transact p2p rather than peer-to-firm. Even with a platform in the middle,
the degree of intermediation in nano contracts is significantly lower than it
is in the central firm model of XaaS.
At this point, it is useful to distinguish nano contracts from seemingly
adjacent technologies: the smart contract and the blockchain.

formative essay conceptualized the smart contract as a digital contract that
algorithmically executes its own terms.82 More recently, Greg Klass offered
a sharper definition, defining smart contracts as software, perhaps run on a
block chain, designed to execute future exchanges or other coordinated
actions between persons who might not otherwise trust one another to
perform 83 An insurance contract, which automatically makes payments if
a predefined event takes place, is a typical example.84
For our purposes, the crux of a smart contract is streamlining contract
execution.85 For this reason, many developers have used smart contracts with
blockchain technology. In broad strokes, blockchain is a protocol that runs
on tens of thousands of networked computers and creates a decentralized
system of trade, meant to allow for trust among complete strangers with a
central platform.86 Just as the blockchain allows one to reliably send bitcoins
to another, it can be adapted to run smart contracts that facilitate other
forms of exchange. And so, while smart contracts do not require the
blockchain, they often take advantage of it. 87 A review of smart contracts on
GitHub repositories shows that 86.5% were tagged by authors with
blockchain-related terms.88
All of this highlights the key difference between the technologies.
While smart contracts try to solve real or perceived problems of execution,
nano contracts are tools of contract formation. They aspire to allow parties
to create contracts at vanishingly low cost and near zero latency. Whether
the exchange is trusted or trustless is not a critical factor in the use of nano
contracts. In fact, there are instances where smart contracts are too slow and
expensive for the purposes of nano contracts, due to the

relatively long settlement time. Whether nano contracts can achieve their
goal, however, depends on their practicability.
1. Practical Constraints that Nano Contracts Must Meet
To succeed in facilitating digital p2p contracts in real time, nano
contracts must overcome certain challenges. Some of these challenges are
legal in nature, while others are extralegal but still affected by legal norms.
By understanding these constraints, we can come to understand what
policies can contribute to, or stymie, the development of nano contracts.
Drawing on the transaction cost framework applied by Michael Munger in
the context of the sharing economy, we can identify five key constraints:89
(1) Triangulation costs must be manageable. Triangulation costs, as
defined by Michael Munger, refer to the combined costs of locating
potential service providers, settling on their price, and agreeing on terms.90
Triangulation costs must be sufficiently low relative to the benefit, or
surplus, of the transaction. Otherwise, parties will not form contracts. In the
context of established markets for commoditized goods, triangulation costs
can disappear into the background. But in other markets, they loom large.
While there is a large supply and demand for used cars, matching buyers and
sellers is challenging.91 Locating a seller with the specific required model,
and then negotiating with them successfully, involves time, risk, and
expense. To remove some of these frictions, people pay car dealerships
significant amounts of money to create working markets. The challenge for
nano contracts is that the transactional surplus is small. Therefore,
triangulation costs must be exceedingly small in comparison to make nano
contracts practical.
(2) Contract formation must be sufficiently streamlined. The
creation of the legally enforceable agreement cannot be too costly, or else
parties would use alternative legal arrangements, informal arrangements, or
abandon the deal altogether. This issue is familiar from history, as the
primary means of contracting at early common law, the covenant, was rarely
used due to its reliance on sealed written documents at a time when a
significant portion of the population was illiterate.92

20 Draft[Vol. __
For macro contract today these frictions are for the most part low
potentially even too low relative to the value of the transaction.93 But, for
nano contracts, where the speed of formation is of the essence, and the
volume of transactions may be extremely large, per-transaction, real-time
expression of assent will add just enough friction and cost to make nano
contracting all but impossible.
(3) Payment processing must be speedy, secure, and cheap. If the
costs of processing payments are too high, the parties will see no benefit in
transacting. When buying a car, payment processing costs are usually
inconsequential. But for small-scale transactions, like buying chewing gum
at a gas station, payment processing costs can be prohibitive in relation. 94
Even some midscale transactions, like paying workers, are often delayed for
weeks because of the alleged transaction costs of paying workers daily.95 If
drivers are to purchase priority at four-way stop signs, the payment must be
smooth, quick, and most importantly, inexpensive.
(4) Dispute resolution must be available, trustworthy, and
efficacious. In the event of a breach of contract, a party can sue in court.
But for many small-scale consumer transactions, standard court proceedings
are prohibitively costly, making it necessary to use alternative mechanisms
such as class actions or small claims courts. The absence of effective dispute
resolution has been linked in the research to the loss of significant
transactional surplus.96 In the four-way stop example, what happens if a
driver speeds into the intersection, ignoring the nano contract?
(5) Enforcement must have a sufficient deterrent effect on
noncompliant parties. For macro contracts, enforcement issues arise with
some regularity, yet this problem is not sufficiently pressing to undermine
the entire system. Some parties evade service, impose delays on the process,
and engage in distractions. Yet, as long as the party is not judgment proof
or poses no credible threat of making herself judgement proof the threat
is considered acceptable.97 If a sanction exists, it must have sufficient bite to
ward off unwanted behavior.

Forms 4 5 (Inst. Law and Econ. Working Paper No. 23-04, 2023) (challenging the proliferation

2. How Nano Contracts Can Meet These Constraints
These constraints appear foreboding at first. The nano stakes of nano
contracts make the system particularly fragile to practical concerns because,
at this scale, there is just too little surplus to cushion transactional costs.
Fortunately, there is a proven answer for most of these issues. The
downscaling of macro contracts to micro contracts in the gig economy
already answered many of these concerns.98 These answers largely involve
two supporting mechanisms, platforms and reputation, although neither is
perfect. The following discusses these answers in order.
Triangulation Costs. The gig economy faced this problem in earnest.
It is costly to triangulate partners for any deal, and for small deals in
particular. That is one central reason why the gig economy had to wait in
the shadows for so long. The solution, enabled by technology, is the
reinvention of an old concept: the two-sided marketplace. The ancient
concept of the bazaar proved something that might otherwise appear
counterintuitive.99 Merchants are better served when they are located
adjacent to other, especially in the case of competing merchants, because it
is easier for buyers to find an appropriate seller.100 Companies like Uber and
Airbnb adopt this model with an additional spin: they moved buyers and
sellers to virtual spaces.
Another solution that avoids the use of platforms is the use of
protocols. 101 Protocols are standards of communication that allow
transacting parties to locate each other and communicate directly. One
example of a protocol that works at scale comes from blockchain-based
exchanges, where two strangers can transfer value without the
intermediation of a platform. The Internet itself also demonstrates the
power of standard protocols in coordinating multiparty information
exchanges, with relatively little centralized authority.
As applied to nano contracts, we can think of a spectrum of solutions
to the triangulation problem differing in the degree of intermediation. We
can conceive of systems of centralized ordering which are heavy in
intermediation, such as those organized by airlines that sell line priority. Less
decentralized are platforms, which can help maintain a marketplace and
means of communication between interested parties, such as the various

online stock and crypto exchanges. And then we can think of direct
communication protocols, which involve no third-party mediation.
Platforms promise, as Orly
besides of course 102 The rise of platforms raises various
concerns, perhaps most notably the rise of monopolies in the presence of
network effects.103 Protocols are more attractive on this score, but their
design, maintenance, and difficulty of propagating updates are still real costs
that must be borne. 104 Fortunately, open-source communities and
government-funded standard-setting organizations provide workable
models for such implementations.
Contract Formation. The solution for the formation problem in the
context of nano contracts relies on advance consent and automated
negotiations. This allows the app to negotiate in real time with very little
latency or cost even in the form of attention.
Some scholars argue that automated contract formation is
problematic, at least when the question arises in the context of smart
contracts.105 The contracting script lacks agency, they reason, and so it
cannot manifest the necessary assent required to enter into a contract.106 The
same holds for nano contracts, which will likewise have to rely on automated
formation methods and advance expressions of assent.
This view of contractual assent is open to debate.107 While everyone
agrees that lack of assent is a bar to enforcement, the procedural forms of
expression of assent are a different matter. In modern contracts, there was
never an issue with authorization of an offer or acceptance by proxy, as
agency law and, well, the ability of any corporation to form valid contracts
makes obvious.108 Nor is the introduction of digital assent especially
problematic, given how consumers routinely enter and courts enforce
online contracts.109 Again, there are good reasons to worry about faulty

assent, but the medium of assent is orthogonal to these concerns. If we
question the validity of clickwrap agreements, it is not because the words are
shown on a screen, but because they are not read or understood.
That nano contracts rely on preestablished manifestations of assent is
likewise immaterial. If a merchant considers buying oil and deposits an offer
to buy a number of barrels with her agent

effective.110 As long as there is a verifiable pedigree of assent, it matters little
for nano formation that the medium is digital, that assent is preestablished,
or that it is conveyed via algorithm.111
Payment Infrastructure. It is surprisingly expensive to transfer
payments. These costs make it difficult to implement any system of
micropayments. 112 This is because traditional payment systems were
designed for large, not small, transactions. As a result, the fees associated
with these transactions can be quite high, making them impractical for use
in micropayment systems.
Fortunately, f startups, and to a lesser
extent, cryptocurrencies, are increasingly building solutions to these
problems. For example, PayPal offers the option to transfer payments
between friends and family at no cost.113 While this remains a far cry from
a costless system of money transfers, developments in the payment space
continue to grow.114 In the meantime, the gig economy resolved this issue
through platform-side accumulation.115 In those regimes, interim payments
automated web access does not create consent to terms of service. However, those cases are deeply
rooted in questions of copyright preemption rather than any substantive view on the quality of
consent. See, e.g., Genius Media Grp. Inc. v. Google LLC, No. 19-CV-7279, 2020 WL 5553639,

20-3113, 2022 WL 710744 (2d Cir. Mar. 10, 2022). In any event, digital contracts are just as
binding as their offline counterparts, as modern battles are waged over form contracts.
Recently, Mark Lemley offered a scathing critique of the modern practice of contract
enforcement of clickwraps, terms of use policies, and similar standard form contracts. Lemley,
supra note 93, at 252 56. These concerns target, however, the issue of consent and deliberation
rather than timing or method. Depending on their specific implementation, nano contracts may
well escape the crosshairs of his and similar critiques.

accumulate after every ride, and the platform sends payment in a single beat,
either after a period of time or after meeting a minimum withdrawal limit.
Nano contracts must adopt one of three solutions. They can use
platforms to accumulate payments before transfers; they can rely on
alternative financial tools, like crypto tokens, that are cheaper to transmit
over an agreed protocol;116 or they can wait until payment infrastructure
improves. A more general lesson from this analysis is that the issue of
payments highlights one source of platform market power the
inefficiency of payment infrastructure and therefore proposes a different
avenue for reducing the dependence on platforms.
Dispute Resolution. Perhaps the most sensitive part of small-stake
contracts is dispute resolution. The problem is well-known: dispute
resolution systems are expensive to operate, their decisions are protracted,
the de minimis doctrine bars litigation,117 and they are generally a poor fit
for small-stake disputes.118 But if disputes are never settled, parties can
breach with impunity, undermining the entire system. The legal system has
developed several mechanisms to deal with small-stakes disputes, from
cheaper arbitration, mediation, and conciliation processes to stake
aggregation via class actions and group litigation.119 Yet, for transactions in
very small scales, especially when they are heterogenous, these solutions can
only provide a partial solution. Thus, the gig economy came to rely on two
complementary mechanisms: reputation120 and in-house adjudication.121
Reputation has proven itself a major disciplining force. To see its role
in the private ordering of small transactions, consider the consequences of
breach. Suppose an Uber driver does not live up to the expected standard
the car is messy, the driver casually scans their phone while driving, and
grating music blares from the speakers. These issues violate
transactional expectations, but none would command sufficient stakes to

warrant a lawsuit.122 The solution is a personal accountability system, in the
form of reputation.123 Uber prompts passengers and drivers to leave a
reputational signature by reviewing each other. If a driver consistently
underperforms, she suffers the risk that passengers will refuse to ride with
her.124 If a passenger is rowdy or aggressive, she might find herself with no
transportation. Research shows that, while imperfect, these systems
effectively promote good behavior among users, even in the absence of
litigation.125
Another solution is used by platforms and normally reserved for more
meaningful transgressions: corporate 126 In these internal
dispute resolution mechanisms, both parties can explain their position,
usually in a limited fashion and without legal representation, and the final
adjudication is given to an employee of the platform.127 The platform will
often issue a quick refund, preferring to err on the side of the user and resolve
the matter internally with the service provider.128 Of course, the platform
compensates itself for such services. But by putting itself in the middle, it
also opens itself to class actions and regulatory interventions. These benefits
may ameliorate some of the concerns we might have with platform power.
122 Of course, passengers are less likely to use the platform if the overall riding experience is
poor. However, since the riding experience is a public good and each driver has minimal
influence on it, drivers may be inclined to act without considering the collective experience,
leading to a free-rider problem. See generally Michael Luca, Designing Online Marketplaces: Trust

Finally, even though the stakes are small, the legal system is not absent.
For example, in the case of a four-way stop,129 if a driver breaches a nano
contract and causes an accident, this will be a higher stake conflict that will
introduce the legal system directly. The court will deem the breaching driver
as being at fault for the accident, analogous to a driver waving at another to
give them the right of way and then crashing into them. This provides
another mechanism of dispute resolution.
Contract interpretation is an adjacent issue. A breach presupposes the
existence of an obligation that was not met, which requires us to first define
the scope of contractual obligations. For digital contracts, interpreting intent
may seem challenging. This issue was repeatedly raised in the context of
smart readers.130 Indeed, ascribing meaning to code looks difficult.131
Fortunately, David Hoffman and Greg Klass have convincingly
resolved the interpretive question.132 Interpretating digital contracts requires
the same toolset that the common law has always used. Importantly, as scale
falls, the scope of transactional complexity falls superlinearly.133 The room
for disagreements in a merger agreement is vastly larger than it is when
buying a Coke from a vending machine. Small transactions, small
disagreements.
The discussion underlies my view that these tiny agreements are real
contracts, rather than pure transactions. However, as noted, at this scale the
boundaries are quite murky, and I can see how some might hold a more
transactional view.
Enforcement. Winning a judgment is not enough; one also has to
collect it. One of the most challenging issues in macro contracts is the
problem that defendants are often judgment-proof (or can deliberately
become so).134 As the stakes fall, this problem trends to zero,135 but a new
one appears in its stead: costs of collection can easily become prohibitive.

Filing a lawsuit with a small claims court costs $15 to $20 in New York,136
$40 in Massachusetts,137 and $85 in Alabama.138 This alone could swamp
any value from winning a judgment on a nano contract.
In micro contracts, there are at least four solutions to this problem.
First is the use of platforms. The platform has deep pockets and is
responsible for residual claims against parties on the platform.139 More
importantly, the platform, as a repeat player, has an incentive to effectively
resolve common disputes and compensate disgruntled users even without
legal action.140 Second is the use of reputation. Even if collection is
expensive, imposing a sanction in the form of a reputation hit is not. Third
is the use of precautions.141 Platforms do not pay drivers until after the trip
is finished, but they charge the passenger in real time. The concern that a
passenger will not pay is thus largely resolved. The fourth solution is escrows,
a solution that can easily be easily implemented by platform-free protocols.
By depositing payments in an escrow, and making the release of payment
conditional on performance, many enforcement problems are resolved. In
smart contracts, the blockchain manages the escrow.142 But this is far from
a fool-proof solution.143 One must still determine whether a party actually

The analysis presented in this Part explains the primary institutional
features that underlie nano contracts and exposes some of the ways
policymaking can further their adoption. On this basis, we now move to
explore how nano contracts can transform several central areas of law:
queues, property, employment, and torts. The crux of the analysis will focus
on the regulation of queues, an area in which we can easily see nano
transformative effects and failure modes. This will allow us to offer
a broader sketch of the issues inherent to other domains of private law. After
describing the potential, the discussion evaluates risks, whether legal
intervention is needed, and in which form.
IV. NANO LINES
A. Nano Contracts and the Problem of Queues
Lines are a painful, if often neglected, public policy problem.145 They
emerge whenever demand outstrips service capacity.146 Busy intersections,
concert tickets booths, amusement parks, customer service
call lines, plane boarding, fast food drive-throughs, bank tellers, a plane on
the tarmac, the DMV, and ticket booths are frustratingly common
examples. Lines are often a conflict zone; a common source of friction that
every so often erupts into wanton displays of violence,147 such as in Black
Friday sales or road rage on congested roads.148 But even in their more
quotidian form, lines exact a toll on our lives. At the DMV alone, Americans
spend an average of 44 minutes per visit.149 One study estimated that

to achieve what their promisors intend, even as they are surrounded by communications in real
languages, intended to be relied on by real people. In such cases, law will confront and must
surmount two temptations: ignoring the code altogether as a mere instrument of performance
or enforcing it as an exculpatory clause written in ciphered .

Americans squander $10.3 billion annually waiting to see their physician or
dentist.150 Another study estimated that traffic congestion cost Americans
over $7.7 billion in 2019.151 This is time that could be used for family,
recreation, work, hobbies, or romance but is instead spent waiting in line.
Most lines today are not regulated. No federal law specifies line
;152 instead,
153 But to say that the line is subject to social
norms does not mean that these norms are prosocial. Indeed, David
Fagundes describes how the nuanced rules of lines are often accompanied
by a shadow threat of social opprobrium that sometimes erupts into
violence.154
Yoram Barzel theory of lines and their cost also helps frame our
discussion.155 Normally, markets allocate scarce resources based on a price
system, using a system of willingness-to-pay ( WtP ). Lines, instead, allocate
resources to those who wait, thus substituting the WtP with a mechanism
that Barzel describes as willingness-to-wait ( WtW ).156 When deciding
whether to join a line, an individual assesses whether the waiting is worth
her time. Depending on the length of the line, some will join, others will
not. As a result, a vicious dynamic emerges. Lines will tend to build up until
the point at which they suck up so much time that they are hardly worth
the wait.157 at a
line that is too long.
Another problem with lines is how they distribute resources. Most
lines adopt an alloc ing of
first in time wins.158 Distributing scarce resources based on who happens to
be first in time may meet some formal criterion of fairness but is neither

allocation, some services offer line priority
159 For example, on trains, first to come heuristics generally
determine who sits first. However, a preference is given to people with
certain conditions such as a physical handicap or old age. Some queues use
human discretion, i.e., triage, to allocate priority.160
for example, people wait according to the scheduled appointment time. But
the staff is given the discretion to give priority to a patient who suffered
acute trauma. In specific cases, social status is used to award priority hence
the existence of VIP lines.
Some scholars express hope that that we can solve problems of waiting
in line now that online lines are an option.161
understand why this is not quite true. Online lines do nothing to produce
any excess service capacity and so the resource in question is just as limited
as it originally was. We still must bide our time until the specialist is available
to see us, our cortado is brewed, and the mechanic gets to our car. True, it
is less painful to wait at home than it is to wait at the post office, but this
sometimes, quite counterintuitively, worsens the problem. Once lines
abandon the implicit cost of standing in line, they lose the signal inherent
to the WtW mechanism. When that happens, many more individuals join
the line, some of them with a fleeting interest in the product, some with
none at all. Some are scalpers and others are bots all of them inflate the
line and distort its desired allocation.162 Relative to a world where those in

need could ensure allocation by waiting in a physical line, an online queue
can make matters worse. Absent some credible signal of need or merit,
online queues are assured to be neither more fair nor more efficient.
Yet, even though the line system is hard to justify on grounds of equity
or efficiency, the status quo proves recalcitrant. This is due to twin
fundamental problems, which we can dub the verification and the
grasshopper problems.
The verification problem arises from the question: how can you tell
whether someone in the fast lane is indeed in an urgent situation? Many
people would claim a special need just to avoid a line. Thus, it might be
necessary to install a costly verifier like a triage nurse at the emergency
room to make judgments. To solve the problem, hospitals must now
employ a full-time health practitioner who spends their expertise on
administration rather than care. Another type of cost is the verification
process itself. 163 Patients may need to produce documents showing
bloodwork, special medical conditions, or urgency. And, at the risk of
infinite regress, there will often be a line to the triage itself, as visitors to the
emergency room know. Then, there is the cost of the mistakes the verifiers
are bound to make in good faith and we are not assured of that good faith.
Given the discretion necessarily allotted to verifiers, some of them abuse
their position to give priority . In the
shadow of all of this, we sometimes see the emergence of a new wasteful
dynamic, where people learn how to game the verifier. In the organ
transplant context, some doctors exaggerate their needs so that the
system will give their patients priority in line (at the expense of the less
fortunate patients who remain to languish in line).164
Even when we can resolve the verification problem reasonably well,
we are exposed to a second-order problem: the grasshopper problem. While
ants, in the sense of planning for the future, others
are carefree grasshoppers 165 A veritable grasshopper might live
time in airports. 166 He always leaves late for the airport. He will occasionally

arrive so late that he is bound to miss his flight unless, that is, he gets to
skip the airport security line. As it turns out, airport personnel will often do
just that, because they attempt to help passengers in a hurry arrive on time
by letting them skip the line.167
What is so troubling about this example is that this is not an example
of the failure of the verification system. The verification method works
perfectly here. The grasshopper is in a real rush, and the airport verifier is
correct to flag him as someone in need. The problem is that by giving the
grasshopper priority, the verifier rewards him for his reckless planning at the
direct expense of other passengers who are better planners. This points at
the general problem with verification systems of triage: they create
unintended grasshopper problems that exacerbate the pressure on the
already scarce resources.
Nano contracts circumvent this patchwork. They offer a solution to
the problem of queues by creating a protocol for parties to directly, quickly,
and potentially anonymously, negotiate the allocation of places in the line
among themselves.168 A nano contract can just as easily be used to auction
off a place in line at airport security, at a baseball stadium, and at the
pharmacy. It can also be used to pay email recipients to afford special
or get priority
for technical support. Notably, t
If the person third in line is trading their places with the person who is last
in line, only the two trading partners are impacted. This places line trading
transactions in the coveted echelon of Pareto improving transactions
deals where at least one person is made better off without harming anyone
else. This is because if the compensation offered is too low, or if one does
not want to wait any longer, they can refuse the switch. It is also possible,
although less likely, that nano contracts would allow a late-comer to jump
to the first place in line, pushing all else back a spot, if the late-comer is
willing to compensate all line-waiters for the added wait. And if people do
not
Quite remarkably, nano contracts simultaneously solve the
verification and the grasshopper problem without the need for costly triage.
They solve the verification problem because it is not enough to just say you
are in a rush. The user must put their money (or tokens) where their mouth
is. The more others need priority, the more one must stake. This verifies
that the user truly values priority. The grasshopper problem is similarly
resolved. If my tardy friend had to pay based on how many people he jumps
in line, he would certainly start planning better. The requirement to pay for
priority rewards good planning and moderately sanctions grasshoppers.
Key to this entire system is voluntary trade. Unlike the current system
which imposes an arbitrary line, nano contracts let people have a choice. I
can retain my place in line if I am in a hurry or need, or I can choose to wait
a bit longer and be compensated for my time. Especially in settings where

transactions are anonymous, we need not worry about coercion or duress,
no more at least than we must worry about bullies who cut in line or the
connected who are given priority over us. Unlike systems like priority
boarding, the compensation goes to us, not to a third-party actor. The four-
way stop is illustrative: it allows all cars to quickly determine who will go
first, while remitting payments between line participants. Another example
is the food delivery service DoorDash. After making the order, the user is
given the option to choose a tip for the driver.169 Because the driver views
the tip before taking the order, this tip can be used to gain priority in the
delivery queue.170
A related advantage is the p2p nature of the nano contract system.
Many firms have seized on the inefficiencies of the status quo and
commoditized lines.171 For example, Six Flags sells the place in line of those
who arrived first to those willing to pay more.172 In socialist countries, there
are fixers, variably known as i machers, 173 who offer to get
people ahead in line for the right fee.174 In the United States, maître ds often
accept bribes in the form of tips to give preference to certain guests.
Concert venues sell VIP tickets for a hefty premium that allow their holder
to avoid the line and enter the venue early.175 Unlike nano contracts, where
payments are remitted to other people in line, in these queue product
transactions, the firm is earning the revenue. Because lines are a source of
revenue, companies like Six Flags may have less incentive to shorten lines.
This is a point about the status quo that must be emphasized. Lines are
already commercialized but not in a p2p manner like a nano contract. Those

incentives to preserve the lines.177
Critically, a nano contract does not even have to use money. Consider
the course priority rules used by the Kellogg School of Management at
Northwestern University.178 Naturally, some courses are in high demand.
Standard systems of registration favor those who plan and sign up early, but
not necessarily those with greatest interest or need in a particular course. The
University decided to implement a queue-auction system. Every student
receives 2,000 3,000 token points.179 Students bid, with no maximum, on
each of their courses according to a set procedure.180 At the end of the
different courses.181 In much the same way, tokens can be allocated for traffic
priority or other forms of access.
The very existence of nano contracts mitigates the risk associated with
a real emergency, we can
get to our destination sooner, even if a bit poorer. While we must pay for
priority, at least we can get it when we need it. This is a great improvement
over our congested roads, where all independent of need, urgency, or
medical condition must wait. And as alluded, one does not have to use the
system every day to benefit from it. It is enough for one to know of its
existence to insure oneself against risks.
If line trading is profitable, it is natural to wonder why we do not see
more of it. The answer comes from the enlightening work of Professor Felix
Oberholzer-Gee of the Harvard Business School. Oberholzer-Gee sought to
examine why markets for time rarely exist.182 To that end, he had ten
researchers approach 500 individuals who waited in line for the cafeteria,
the train station, and the DMV.183 Pretending to be in a hurry, the
researcher offered to cut in line in exchange for a $0 $10 payment.184
His first finding is consistent with much of the above. The more
money offered, the more people were willing to forego their place in line
(from 45% with no payment to 76% with $10).185 However, only a small

minority of people agreed to actually take the payment: they simply let the
researcher pass them while refusing payment.186 It seems that most people
used the offer of money as a makeshift verification mechanism but were
prevented by social norms from actually accepting it. This is why higher
amounts yielded better responses, even though they were not collected. The
problem, of course, is that when payments are not remitted, the credibility
of payment offers vanishes. This allows those who do not play by the social
rules to manipulate others.
Interestingly, Oberholzer-Gee pushed the line a bit too far. He
approached some of the people who previously let others cut ahead of them
in line a second time.187 He offered them, again, payment to cut ahead.188

While favors have a positive connotation, they obey a much more
complex logic. Because line trading is viewed as a favor, people act with
outright hostility when they feel that their boundaries are transgressed. And
because it is uncomfortable to ask for a favor from a stranger, many of us
feel uncomfortable asking others for help, even when we are in a real hurry.
At the same time, we are all too familiar with those who do not concern
themselves with the opinions of their peers and liberally cut in line.
Nano contracts do much more than facilitate exchange. They create a
norm in which asking for priority does not require calling for special
favors.191 They also implement a mechanism that reduces the friction
involved in trades for time. This highlights a major contribution of nano
contracts: opening up opportunities of mutual interest that are shrouded
today by social and transactional frictions.

The overall effect is, of course, nuanced. While this may increase
leave late, this is not necessarily a bad outcome.
Research shows that when resources are scarce, people prefer systems where
those who wait longer receive greater compensation over systems where
priority is assigned based on either a system of lottery or surge pricing.192 If
the success of priority access in parks and airplanes is a guide, consumers
adjust quickly to such market norms.193
B. Legal Policy on Nano-Contracting Lines
Nano contracts offer a general solution to lines. In doing so, nano
contracts solve significant problems like permitting people in a rush to gain
priority, transferring payments to people with greater patience, and avoiding
the costs of verifiers and grasshoppers.194 But the proliferation of nano
contracts would also entail a market creep into areas previously governed by
social norms.195 They also engender distributive concerns regarding their
effect on those living close to the social margin, alongside other efficiency,
political, and ethical concerns. Whether the legal system should regulate
nano contracts, or even permit them at all, depends on our evaluations of
these potential concerns.
Perhaps the broadest and most sustained critique of line
commodification is that offered by Harvard philosopher, Michael Sandel.196
In his book, Sandel seeks to defend the separation of lines and markets,
advocating for what he calls the ethic of the queue. 197 This moral system
holds that allocating goods through lines is desirable in and of itself, at least
relative to price mechanisms.198 A central tenet of the queue ethic is the
belief that WtW is better than, or at least not clearly worse than, a WtP
system. If society wants to allocate resources to those who value them the
most, WtP is limited, Sandel argues, because it does not reflect real need but

rather the ability to pay for the good in question.199 He notes, with visible
annoyance, how baseball fans who sit in the expensive front rows often come
late and leave early, manifesting only passing interest in the game, unlike the
other less affluent diehard fans.200 Lines further embody a democratic ethos,
he claims, visibly affirming our equality as we all languish in waiting,
regardless of wealth, race, or creed.201 Thus, Sandel finds the queue ethic to
be a superior alternative to market mechanisms of allocation.202
is unpersuasive. It would
require a great feat of line drawing to explain how a market economy that
allocates most of its goods through markets and prices suddenly turns
unethical when it comes to lines. Sure, markets and prices have their
discontents, and there are those who condemn all market transactions as
morally suspect. But in a society where it is permissible for dealerships to
sell, say 2023 Subaru Outbacks based on WtP, how can one justify the
dissipation of this principle at the line to the dealership? This position is
mystifying because lines are downstream of the price system. Lines tend to
emerge when goods are being sold at a price that lies below the market
clearing price.203 In our society, the manufacturer is generally free to set
prices as it sees fit. If it is permissible for Subaru manufacturers and dealers
to raise prices until no line exists, and then offer sale prices when they have
exhausted the initial pool of buyers, why is it a moral wrong to keep prices
low and sell line priority instead?

between willingness to pay for a shorter line and economic status, which
suggests that payments do measure a real difference in valuation.209
The darkest side of the issue is that, from an egalitarian perspective,
we must be cautious about championing WtW. There is an implicit
assumption that somehow WtW is more progressive than WtP. The idea
seems to be that because our society has inequality in the distribution of
material goods, WtW is an equalizing force.
On reflection, this is wrong. To put the point bluntly, we simply do
not live in a society where free time is equally divided. This is the very thrust
of Thorstein leisure class framework.210 A struggling mother of
four working a minimum-wage job will not see much benefit from a system
that rewards those who can spare the time to wait in line. And, of course,
money and time are often fungible, making inequality in one transform into
inequality in the other.211 For instance, some people hired line waiters,
paying them as much as $6,000 to gain the right to watch the seminal oral
argument in the Supreme Court on same sex marriage.212 Even when people
wait for themselves, reliance on WtW can be regressive. Lawyers should be

I want to make a stronger argument. In many situations, nano

offering people a meaningful choice. They can elect whether they want to
retain their place in line, or whether they want to spend a few more minutes
idling in exchange for direct compensation. If a person has a bit of extra
time, they may be able to leave the post office with a few extra dollars in
their pockets. And if they are in a rush, they can just keep their place (or pay
a little to get priority).215 As long as choice is preserved, nano contracts offer
a potential improvement over the status quo. By contrast, attempts to
maintain the status quo often unwittingly harm those are less well off.216
There may still be a residual concern with a world in which the
wealthy tend to be first in line. Indeed, that is already the case under the
current system elite airline members board first, toll roads give priority to
those who can afford them, and VIP tickets create a fast track for those who
can afford them. Nano contracts, however, offer a way to remedy some of
these issues. If we identify a systemic access concern with a specific type of
line, it is possible to issue tradable tokens on the platform. We can allocate
priority tokens to people on a monthly or annual basis, which can be used
in addition to, or instead of, money.217 This offers another way to target
vulnerable parties, which is not possible under the current system.
While I think Sandel I do believe that there
is an important kernel there, and that it offers some valuable lessons for the
regulation of nano contracts. Rather than a blanket objection to
commoditized lines, we should be attentive to the type of good that is being
allocated.
It is one thing to allocate primary resources such as Subaru Outbacks
and tickets to baseball games based on WtP
allocate publicly provisioned goods in this way. This is because public
provisioning already implies a judgment that market allocation of the
underlying good is faulty. Prominent examples where notions of queue ethic
may be applicable include the line to the voting booth, kidney transplants,
a place in line for the draft or jury duty, fresh water during a natural disaster,

waiting for a court to render a judgment, or access to medical resources
during a pandemic.218 What ties these examples together is that society
decided that the goods should be allocated outside of markets.219 In those
cases it will certainly be true that commoditizing the line would undermine
this goal. Explicit markets in lines in such instances may be offensive to our
sense of equality and justice by expressing the view that
votes, lives, or sufferings are more valuable than those of others. By creating
markets in those domains, we risk changing the very nature of the good
itself. As Sandel notes, [h]ow a good is allocated may be part of what makes

By focusing our attention on these types of goods, we can come to
appreciate the need to regulate, and sometimes even ban, nano contracts in
certain contexts. The quest for policymakers will be two-fold: (1) identify
these contexts, and (2) find measures that can actually work to limit the
proliferation of nano contracts. To an extent, legislators have already begun
this quest by making it illegal to trade in certain rights.222 Interestingly, there
is no specific sanction for queue trading in the context of public provision
of supplies during an emergency, but it is quite likely to be frowned upon.
At the same time, it is important to recognize that limiting private
contracting, side deals, and shadow bargains is difficult. As the Oberholzer-
Gee study shows, some lines are partly protected from the incursion of
markets by social norms.223 As particular applications of nano contracts can
be designed to allow people to trade under the screen of anonymity,
compliance with social norms will become a challenge. Therefore, it is
important to heed the constraints identified in Section III.B,224 as its
solutions usually involve reliance on broader institutions and regulators may
have more success regulating these institutions than the parties themselves.

So far, I have argued that nano contracts have progressive effects and
bring social utility. However, despite
grasshopper problem, there is one additional efficiency-based concern. This
is the problem of cloggers. Recall the four-way stop example. There, I
assumed that that those four drivers were already on the road. But nano
contracts can also induce more people to go on the road. With nano
contracts in place, cloggers may find it profitable to drive aimlessly, in the
hope of collecting money from drivers who are in a rush. Cloggers introduce
delays to all drivers, increase the cost of travel for drivers in a rush, and waste
their own time.
Despite this real possibility, cloggers do not deal a fatal blow to the
use of nano contracts to solve queues. This is because cloggers must bear real
costs when they engage in clogging. Airlines oversell flight tickets,
calculating that some passengers will miss their flights. When flights are
overbooked, however, airlines offer handsome payments to people who are
willing to forgo their place in line. 225 Yet, there is no evidence of widespread
abuse by cloggers who strategically book busy flights.
Because of these costs and the relatively modest payments from nano
contracts, it is unlikely that clogging will be widespread. Even in the
situations where clogging does emerge as a problem, we should consider two
responses. One is indifference: a small degree of clogging is tolerable, given
that the payments go to people who demonstrably lack more productive
avenues to eke out a living. The second is the adoption of keyhole solutions,
like banning clogging and imposing restrictions on clogging behavior (e.g.,
cars that drive aimlessly for hours will not be able to collect payments).
In summary, nano contracts offer a natural solution to the problem of
queues. Evaluation of their merits suggests that, in most cases, there are real
advantages both ethics- and efficiency-based to their adoption. True,
we need to exercise caution in the case of publicly provisioned goods, as
nano contracts can crowd out social norms and corrode the goods
themselves. However, for the vast array of products and services, nano
contracts offer a significant improvement over the current system. Payments
made through nano contracts can be progressive, providing people of limited
means with another way to monetize their spare time. Nano contracts also
reward planners and waiters, while relieving all of us from anxiety about the
future. This is not to say that a hands-off regulatory approach is necessary.
Regulatorary involvement will be needed for tasks such as issuing tokens and
delimiting permissible uses. But, as a general outlook, nano contracts hold
important potential for improving the social problem of queues.

food exchanges each day.237 While not the same as an individual-to-
individual nano lease, the platform is arguably demonstrative of the viability
of a marketplace for excess cooking capacity. We might imagine neighbors

Beyond these examples, many assets owned by individuals can be
converted to use nano leases. Used books, garage-stored bikes, PC
computing power, right of way through their backyard, video games, a
mailbox address, extra closet space, access to the yard water hose, garage
access, fruit trees, and muscadine vines. Once transaction costs are low
enough, the options appear unlimited.
A few substantive caveats are in order. First, some physical costs and
limitations impede nano leases. A lawn mower, to use an example raised in
the literature, still needs to be transported from yard to yard. And given high
demand during the weekends, lawn mowers may not be perfectly susceptible
to sharing.243 Some degree of idleness is inevitable, even with ideal nano
contracts. Second, dispute costs can arise whenever a person returns the
lawnmower broken, downloads illegal materials using our IP, or commits
the cardinal sin of putting a dog ear in our book. Third, and more deeply,

costs involved in sharing them. The gig economy has shown that, once

their autonomy.
The benefits of nano leases go beyond putting idle capacity to use.250
To lessors, monetizing underutilized assets can be an important source of
income and help defray bills, while freeing up space. Nano leasing can
improve household liquidity, a deep concern that affects low-income
households with particular force.251
To lessees, the availability of nano leases makes it less necessary to
own, license, or rent goods in the first place.252 For example, knowing that
we can reliably access a laptop on demand can make it less necessary to travel
with one. Leasing also has the advantage of allowing specialization. Owning
own bandwidth connection involves research into the following:
conducing market analysis for providers, selecting the correct router,
identifying the optimal transmission channel, and updating and sometimes
even replacing the firmware. But nano lessees are spared all that trouble: they
decide how much they are willing to pay and then just connect. Potential
lessors can specialize in providing bandwidth services, letting others enjoy
their acquired expertise.
Heralding nano leases is the rise of the XaaS model discussed above.253
Consider, in particular, the model of Product as a Service ( PaaS ).254 Under
this model, a firm takes a product that it would normally sell and instead
offers it on a pay-per-use or subscription service. For example, Homie offers
individuals the ability to treat their washing machines, dryers, and
dishwashers as a service for which they pay-per-use, with the company being

Nano contracts allow us to better utilize our resources, which

systems of mutual governance to systems of private property.259 Nano

a world where governance is dominated by the latter.260 The following
discussion briefly outlines some key concerns.
One concern about nano contracts is that their use challenges the
concept of private ownership. Under the Hegelian developmental thesis, the
and maintenance of capacities and self-understandings that make up free
261 This raises interesting questions for nano contracts: is
something severed when we no longer own basic property? Is the leasing-self
different in important ways from the owning-self? What aspects of property
are tied up to autonomy: rights to exclude, abilities to break and shape, or
the temporal continuity of our relationship to objects we can call our own?
Perhaps something profound is lost when our interactions with goods are
tentative and time-bound. These are questions that future property scholars
will want to debate.
The endowment effect, a cornerstone of behavioral economics and a
highly influential idea in legal scholarship, suggests that ownership imbues
goods with special meaning.262 In experiments conducted around the world,
researchers found that people who own goods value them more highly than
they do when given the option to purchase them.263 However, when goods
are designated as trade goods, this effect disappears.264 For those who believe
in the endowment effect, nano leasing should give pause. It seems that
hyper-leasing, either as a lessee or a lessor, could fundamentally alter the
value people endow in their property.
There are also consequences for the notion of leasing itself.265 For
example, Airbnb has not only changed the way people monetize their
property rights, but it has also changed the meaning of ownership.266 People

who rent their homes on Airbnb often make changes to make the space more
inviting, keep it cleaner, and install better amenities.267 While some of these
changes are innocuous, even salutatory, they can also redefine how people
think about their homes: from a private sanctuary to a place of business.268
Contrary to what one might expect, the erosion of ownership may be
compatible with an array of anti-consumerist, environmentalist, and Marxist
philosophies.269 Under these theories, private property and excessive
consumption are objectionable. Some of these ideas can be traced back to
the work of economist Thorstein Veblen, who argued that conspicuous
consumption, fueled by a desire to signal social status, drives consumers to
consume in excess.270 The result, as explored by thinkers like Juliet Schor, is
an overconsumption that contributes to environmental degradation.271 One
solution advocated by these movements is the sharing of resources among
members and the removal of the stigma around owning few items.
Communal living arrangements, such as the family, private clubs, and
Moshavim and Kibbutzim, all exemplify models of shared property
governance.272 Nano contracts involve a profit motive and can lead to
concentration of capital, so they are by no means equivalent to these
arraignments. Nevertheless, they may also address concerns with private
property and waste. Nano contracts allow multiple people to share the same
goods and thereby considerably reduce private ownership. The greater
utilization of assets would reduce the need to overproduce items like drills
and tractors, mitigating the toll on the environment. To the individual,
nano contracts could offer a roadmap to a self that is not anchored by the
need to own. Life-as-a-service, if you will.
Jurisprudentially, nano contracts also have a disruptive effect, going
to the very heart of the legal notion of property. As Henry Smith explains,

property is an architecture a system, rather than the collection of isolated
functions implied by the metaphor of the easily separable bundle of sticks.
As Smith argues, property is, first and foremost, about the ability to put
assets to use,273 with other features (e.g., exclusion rights and leasing rights)
emerging only as means to this end.274 Accordingly, many of the features of
property law are contingent. For example, the right to exclude is not an
inherent aspect of property, but rather an attempt to solve a problem of
transaction (or, more specifically, information)
transaction cost world we could use all governance all the time, whether
supplied by government or through super-fine grained contracting among
all the concerned 275 Nano contracts arise from asymptotically low
transaction costs between a large mass of users. Thus, they offer the ability
to develop radically different governance mechanisms, far more fine-tuned
regimes.
Contracts do not go unscathed either. Nano leases straddle sales,
leases, and licenses and present a difficult question for their classification.
For Article 2 of the U.C.C. to apply, the contract must involve a sale of
goods, which means the passing of title.276 While this may be true of some
nano contracts, Article 2 of the U.C.C. will not apply to, say, bandwidth
access agreements. Further, the transactional scale of nano contracts makes
Article overall regulatory approach far less appealing. Unlike sellers of
heavy equipment, it makes little sense to offer parties to nano leases extensive
inspection rights or insist on perfect tender rules.277 These rights become
increasingly less applicable when the scale is as small as someone who is
licensing picking rights from their prolific mulberry tree.
Some transactions may be thought of as nano leases, thus controlled
by U.C.C. Article 2A.278 However, at this scale, leases become hard to
distinguish from licenses. The proper classification has significant practical
significance, as it affects matters such as jurisdiction, termination rights, and
the availability of self-remedies. Under 2A-103(J), a lease involves the
transfer of possession,279 but a transfer of possession is also consistent with a
license. To distinguish the two, courts find licenses for non-exclusive grants

revocation at these time scales is often irrelevant. Thus, when a nano
these issues become extremely hard to disentangle.
In terms of policy, one major concern with nano contracts for excess
capacity is distributional. Take the case of broadband. As noted, most users
underutilize their capacity.283 As a result, broadband suppliers can offer
better pricing, factoring in actual average usage rates. If certain home users
start commercializing their excess capacity, actual usage will rise, increasing
service costs for the providers. It is likely that costs will rise, not only for
those who nano lease access, but for everyone. This cross subsidy creates
unfairness between consumers. There are instances where increased capacity
has broader and less obvious effects. In an apartment building, it matters
whether an apartment is utilized by a single person or revolving strangers.
Not necessarily because of the apartment space capacity itself, but because
of greater utilization of shared resources such as elevators, a sense of
community, or simply noise.
At the same time, nano contracting can reduce net capacity usage.
Because Uber increases the revenue from driving, it can lead to greater road
usage. Nonetheless, a study on with respect to road capacity
found that Uber actually reduced congestion by increasing vehicle
occupancy. Further, surge pricing possibly reduces the capacity load in time
of great demand.284 A study of car sharing found improved welfare,

What contracts can do contracts can also undo. One lesson from
copyright law is that there are strong upstream pressures to use contractual
schemas to limit the ability to utilize property rights downstream.286 If
aggressive nano leasing reduces demand for goods, if it increases bandwidth
usage, or if it allows owners to extract rents from goods, producers may seek
to use contractual mechanisms to prevent nano leases. As an analogy,
producers of electronic devices have made it deliberately difficult to contract
out repair services of 287 In a similar
fashion, Internet providers may limit the ability to share bandwidth in its
terms of service. In the case of repairs, this limitation led to the formation
of a large advocacy coalition, demanding a right to repair.288 Should there
be a right to nano lease?
In sum, nano leasing offers a way to drastically increase the utilization
of assets. This effect can usher in great social advances, contribute to the
ethics of consumption, and reduce the resource load on the planet. These
benefits notwithstanding, a move from property to contracts raises several
difficult concerns. There is the philosophical question about autonomy and
self-definition in a world where little belongs to us. Then there are some
distinctly legal questions about the classification of nano contracts and the
type of rights that should be associated with a nano lease, relative to a macro
lease. Distributionally, nano contracts have ambiguous effects, and there are
at least some areas where few will be enriched at the expense of the many.
The passage of ordinances in many cities against short-term rentals exposes
how expanding rental rights can have significant effects on communities.289
As we move to a nano contract future, these questions will become
increasingly important.

Nano jobs like

For a close comparison, the gig economy has had a profound impact on the
lives of millions of Americans. Estimates are speculative, but one finds fifty-
nine million adults participating in it almost 36% of the entire US
workforce.290 This transition from jobs to gigs represents a shift towards the
utilization of skills on a more casual basis than traditional employment
contracts and independent contracts. However, the gig economy has not
always been a positive force, and the impact it has had on employment and
employee rights has been a major point of contention and focus of scholarly
debate in recent years.291
There is plenty of room at the bottom, even in labor markets. Indeed,
services such as MTurk (wherein a worker might be paid $1 to watch a 1-
) already blur
the line between micro and nano contracts.292 Many people are willing to
use their idle time, such as during commutes or in between meetings, to
engage in short-term paid tasks. For example, individuals with relevant
expertise could provide casual customer service, solve technical problems,
label data for AI projects, monitor security cameras, clean public spaces, or
recharge electric scooters. Just think of the users of public transportation and
how they can leverage the long, circuitous rides if they could access nano
jobs on their commute. The potential applications of nano contracts in labor
markets are vast and could provide new opportunities for individuals to earn
income and for businesses to access specialized skills on demand.
The rise of the gig economy has made the point straightforward. There
is a large untapped market for labor. Tapping into it can vastly improve the
fortunes of millions. Nano work offers workers the opportunity to engage
in work with little commitment. There is also an important, less obvious
progressive element to fleeting nano engagements. One lesson from policies
like California Bottle Bill (whereby a small payment is paid when bottles are
properly disposed)293 is that providing opportunities for people to work on

B. The Legal Policy on Nano Work
Considering the regulatory implications of nano gigs requires a sense
of their effect on the rights of workers. A good source of inspiration here is
the gig economy, although in some ways what the net
effects are, to borrow from Zhou Enlai. 295
One persistent line of critique against the gig economy depicts its
value as mere regulatory arbitrage. That is, rather than providing any actual
hygiene, and other regulatory requirements that apply to taxis and hotels . . .
. [S]haring economy firms flourish by reproducing existing services without
296 Recent work has attempted to evaluate
these concerns. Using an extensive data source, researchers from Harvard
Business School and the London School of Economics concluded that this
critique may be overstated.297 They found that regulatory arbitrage only
explains part of the value of such labor agreements.298 In fact, they find that
this economy provides tremendous value to workers who, relative to their
alternative opportunities, earn staggeringly 26% higher wages.299
Another critique comes from the potential transformation of
employment law to contracts. Employment law is meant to create a
mandatory framework that constrains private contracts and offers some
minimum protections for workers.300 The gig economy has been accused of
creating a new class of workers,301 what economist Guy Standing calls the

precariat, 302 whose source of income is ever contingent. Many legal
scholars, such as Catherine Fisk, have thus called for an expansion of labor
protections to these workers.303 A large legal battle is currently underway,
attempting to define Uber drivers as employees of Uber.304 Recently, the
Supreme Court of England ruled that Uber drivers are workers, although it
left open questions of whether they are also employees.305 On this side of the
pond, Uber drivers are still not recognized as employees, although the legal
battle continues.306 The difficulties imposed by Uber to legal classifications
are an order of magnitude larger for nano contracts. If
involvement with the platform can be measured in hours, then nano work
will be measured in minutes at most. This will make it ever more difficult
to allot nano workers vacation days, social benefits, minimum wage, and
other employment protections. The policy reaction can be to adapt labor

hole of 1930s- 307 Instead, it might be necessary to expand the
social net, either through Universal Basic Income or other social programs,
regardless of employment status.308
A different type of reaction comes from focusing on those who live
the most precarious lives. Some forms of nano employment solve a
longstanding problem among those who face barriers to joining the formal
job market for reasons such as discrimination, criminal history, and mental
wellness. One unexpected lesson from bottle recycling programs is that they
provide an important source of income for extremely poor households; by
one estimate, as much as 6.8% of their annual income. 309 Nano
employment, like the bottle recycling example, can be an important anti-
poverty mechanism.

Just as much as nano leases solve the problem of asset underutilization, nano
contracts can be cast as solving the problem of labor underutilization. But is

this a problem? To some, idleness and leisure are activities (or anti-activities)
that help define the self. When one works, one is under the command and
prerogative of the employer. If nano contracts expand the space of life
designated as work, they shrink the space that is more easily identifiable as
autonomous, where our own caprice reigns. Philosopher Byung-Chul Han
has chastised late-stage capitalism as an era where exploitation comes from
the self: [E] 310 On this view, nano
contracts threaten the last vestiges of individuality by expanding the fences
of our work camp to every second of leisure.
I hesitate to offer a general response to such general philosophical
concerns. However, it is at least worth noting that for many people, shorter
engagements can be life changing. The gig economy allowed many people
who were shunned by traditional labor markets to find a source of
income single parents who could not commit to a regular nine-to-five
job, small business owners who had seasonal lulls, or a recent graduate
waiting to land her first job. Nano gigs can do the same for those looking to
utilize extra time waiting
In sum, this Section presented a potential application of nano
contracts to employment. The flexibility they offer is unmatched and the
potential is tremendous. But nano work also makes the legal challenges of
defining employment, and ensuring employee rights, harder than ever. If
employment collapses to contract, a century of worker rights advocacy will
crumble. Nano work also raises some preliminary questions about inequality
and the need for demarcation between the space of work and the space of
self.
VII. NANO ACCIDENTS
Famously, the Coase theorem holds that the primary reason why we
need tort law is transaction costs.311 Accidents, like sparks emitted from
passing trains into adjoining fields, create costs and risks. If transaction costs
were low, these problems could have been solved by farmers and railways
directly, as they would negotiate to the efficient outcome. But, as Coase and
the legal scholarship that built on him vividly recognized, ours is not that
world.312 In our world, transaction costs are sufficiently high to prevent such
bargains, making it necessary for the law of tort to decide the outcome of
accidents. Since then, some of the most important works in tort theory have
tried to design rules that would approximate the results of bargains under
ideal conditions.313 As the sophistication and complexity of this literature

shows, the task of designing optimal tort rules is challenging, and real life
tort rules likely fall short of this ideal.
Nano contracts will not abolish transaction costs, but they can make
many of them close to trivial. The four-way stop illustrates a situation where
transaction costs impede the efficient allocation of the scarce resource (i.e.,
right of way) as it will be unrealistic for drivers to discuss among themselves
who should get the right of way.
Traditionally, contracts and torts involve mostly separate realms.
While contracts are based on agreement and intent, torts address
nonconsensual interactions accidents. The contention here is that nano
contracts expand the range of possible consensual agreements. As such, they
can turn large spheres of tort law into contract law. To evaluate this
contention, let us consider such an instance, using a modified version of the
scenario suggested by Coase:314
A train is speeding down the tracks in Iowa. Suddenly, the
computer reports an imminent electrical load. To avoid damaging the
engine, the operator must quickly decide where to emit the sparks: to the
right, where there is a corn field; or to the left, where there is a soybean field.
The operator knows that the sparks will cause damage either way. A decision
must be made quickly. What should the train operator do?
Tort law tries to
law, the train company will have to pay the field owner for all the harm its
sparks caused.315 The hope is that if the train company will internalize the
costs of the accident, it will be motivated to minimize the amount of harm
its sparks cause. 316 However, applying tort law in this situation is
problematic. Estimating the actual harm caused by the sparks is difficult,
and it is likely that the legal system s assessments deviate significantly from
the true amount of harm inflicted. This is further complicated because juries
may be systematically biased in favor of farmers or trains, so even on average
damages will not equal the true harm. Another complication is the effect of
time. Currently, the market price for soybeans is much lower than corn.317
But these prices fluctuate heavily over time and the operator must decide
without a confident sense of what prices are or will be at the time of
adjudication.
Now suppose the market rates for soybean and corn are $1,118 and
$758 respectively and admittedly, this example requires more in the way
of suspension of disbelief that the farmers have a nano contract app that
can automatically communicate with adjacent conductors. Using a real-time
lowest price auction, the conductor can negotiate the accident with the
farmers. Neither farmer wants the sparks to cause harm to their crops, but

the corn farmer knows that the expected harm to their field is $1,118.
Therefore, they bid $5,000 to protect their profits. This allows the corn
farmer to come out ahead in the event of an accident. The soybean farmer
also sees an opportunity to protect their profits. Since the expected harm to
their field is only $754, they can outbid the corn farmer and ask for only
$4,000. Even at this reduced rate, the soybean farmer will come out ahead
from the accident. Since they will still profit even if they bid $3,000, they
will underbid accordingly. Through this split-second auction process, it is
expected that the soybean farmer will win with a bid of $1,117. This will
cause the conductor to emit sparks onto the soybean field, causing harm of
$754. The soybean farmer comes out $363 ahead, and the more valuable
crop is saved.
From a social perspective, this is the desirable outcome we want
the inevitable spark discharge to cause minimal harm. The tort system,
however, cannot guarantee this outcome because its valuation only occurs
after the critical decision has been made. On the other hand, a nano contract
can assure that this desirable outcome will follow. It is worth noting that
even if the trains computer could consult commodity prices in real-time,
this outcome would not be guaranteed. Negotiated contracts offer a real
advantage over market prices, especially when the owner plans to use their
assets in nontraditional ways.
Nano contracts also offer a distributional advantage. Under the tort
system, the soybean farmer is only entitled to $754, whereas under the nano
contract system, the farmer could recover $1,117. If in a given context
victims are systematically poorer than tortfeasors, or if tortfeasors can escape
judgements, this would be a progressive improvement over the status quo.318
But even absent such distributional considerations, a working system of
If accidents were completely subject to contracting, we might have to
worry about a different problem. If an accident is inevitable, the farmers act
as a monopoly, and they can demand an arbitrarily high price from the train
company. Tort law, however, breaks this monopoly. If the parties fail to
negotiate, the standard rules of tort law apply. This means that the train
company will have to pay the farmer for the harm caused, as later assessed
by the court. This assures us that the parties will nano contract only when
they deem the outcomes superior to those of protracted litigation with
uncertain valuation.
A broader question is the dynamic effects of nano contracts on
accidents. If this road is accident-prone (and there are, indeed, various sites
where accidents are common), the soybean farmer will soon make the same

realization as father in Catch-22.319 That is, she can make
more money from not growing anything. That way, she can collect $1,117
every time a train emits sparks with little effort.320 While this seems initially
like a perverse outcome, it is actually quite desirable. The farmer would only
abandon their crops if the probability of accidents is sufficiently high. But if
accidents in an area are so common, society is well served by having safe
areas where sparks can be discharged. On the other side of the ledger, train
companies may invest more in anti-spark technology to avoid those regular
and predictable payments.
This example offers a view on how nano contracts can efficiently
minimize harm to victims from accidents and offer compensation for the
residual harm that is agreeable to the victim. Such a solution can be extended
to many other instances, although caution is required. For reasons that
roughly track the discussion on the commodification of queues,321 we
should be wary about the contractualization of accidents that involve
bodily harm. In such cases, nano contracts can violate deep moral and social
norms. But in many other cases, like those involving trespass or property
damage, nano contracts present an opportunity to rethink the alienability of
accidents.
parties would negotiate the most efficient outcome in the absence of
transaction costs.322 If accidents cannot be economically prevented, the nano
contract would ensure that the harm is minimized. In any event, the optimal
result would ensue, but there will be no need for direct state involvement.
The parties will negotiate the cost of accidents among themselves. Further,
if society cares about the distribution of costs, it can do so via changes to the
background tort regime.
VIII. CONCLUSION
At this late point, some readers will find themselves in one of two
groups. One group will see nothing inevitable about nano contracts. A legal
sci-fi that can be easily dismissed out of hand. Another group will have the
exact opposite reaction: nihil sub sole novum (nothing new under the sun).
To them, nano contracts amount to no more than a rebranding of gig
economy agreements, if not of plain vanilla contracts. The former will find
nano contracts fantastic, as they will never materialize; the latter will find
them trite, as they have always existed.

grows crops. Thus, in accident-prone sites, tort law can lead to excessive and futile investment.

If there is still room for pleading with these readers, I think both
groups have missed out on a key aspect of the Article. Consider the wise
insight of science fiction author Frederick Pohl [A] good science-fiction
story should be able to predict not the automobile but the traffic jam 323
Accordingly, the point here is not to make precise predictions to two decimal
points about a bright future, or to claim to have reinvented the law of
contracts. The goal of this Article is to think, in a sustained manner, about
the culmination of deep existing trends, such as the digitization of
transactions, nanonization in the XaaS sphere, minimization of
transactional scale, and the tokenization of ownership.324 Transactions want
to be small. What emerges from this investigation considering the history of
contracts is the insight that scale has a quality of its own. Smaller transaction
scale opens new markets, some exciting and liberating, others troublesome
and antithetical to our values. Diminishing transactional scale brings with it
both the car and the traffic jam. Paying attention to these implications is
worth the price of admission.
There is plenty of room at the bottom. While I am cautiously
optimistic about the future of nano contracts, there is definitely room for
good faith disagreement over whether the net is positive or negative.
Clearing up lines effectively, liberating people from the onus and the chase
of ownership, and providing new job opportunities can be socially
transformative. At the same, we can recognize that there is certainly
something unheimlich about a person without possessions (or rather, a
person with unlimited possessions, but none of them hers) and something
of the
queue ethics clearly shows that some find it uncanny to let those in a rush
or with less patience buy priority from those willing to sell it, and letting
people cut in line to the voting booth certainly triggers ethical
goosebumps.325 These differing judgments suggest that there is also plenty
of room for scholarly analysis: which future trajectory do we want to pursue?
How might we influence the market? And on a more meta level, should we
think about these issues now or let the market play out and attempt to repair
the issues ex post?
This article did not attempt to solve all these traffic jams. Rather, it
seeks to offer a clear perspective on nano contracts, their structure, and legal
implications for lines, property, employment, and torts. Hopefully, these are
challenges that would urge us to think about new frameworks the next time
we are stuck at a four-way stop.
