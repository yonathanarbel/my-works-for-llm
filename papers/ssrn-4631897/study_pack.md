## Elevator pitch

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that new technologies are enabling "nano contracts"—extremely small-scale agreements governing ephemeral, minuscule-value interactions previously outside formal law. While nano contracts can unlock new opportunities and efficiencies, they also carry significant risks, challenge effective regulation, could collapse private law boundaries, and reveal scale's neglected role in private law.
