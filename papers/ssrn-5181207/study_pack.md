## Elevator pitch

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that a "capability-safety gap" in AI development, where private firms reap rewards while society bears risks, creates a social misalignment. He proposes using tax policy to address this by re-conceptualizing R&D credits to incentivize safety research, offering consumer credits for safe AI, imposing penalties for non-compliance, and redistributing penalty revenue. This approach aims to embed safety imperatives directly into the economic architecture of AI development, aligning private profit with social welfare.
