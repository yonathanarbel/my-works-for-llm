TAX LEVERS FOR A SAFER AI FUTURE
Mirit Eyalѳ & Yonathan Arbelƴ
This Article argues that tax policy can become a powerful tool for the development of
safer systems of artificial intelligence (AI). Investment in AI capabilities is at a fever
pitch, drawing capital, talent, and computing resources from most sectors of the
economy. While the development of capable AI systems promises princely rewards to
their creators, investment in safety remains anemic, reduced to paltry budgets and
safety-washing initiatives. This misalignment has produced a rapidly expanding
capability-safety gap: the difference between what these systems can do and what they
can do safely. We lack meaningful assurances that tomorrow’s powerful systems will
safeguard the life and dignity of individuals, withstand adversarial attacks, and
function reliably in novel contexts. At the heart of this gap lies a simple, bitter truth—
while the rewards from powerful models are private, the harms are socialized.
We term this the social misalignment problem and propose that tax levers can play a
critical role in its resolution. Our proposed framework reconceptualizes the existing
sprawling system of R&D credits to incentivize investments in AI safety. The
framework integrates four mechanisms: (1) targeted rewards for basic and applied
research on AI safety; (2) consumer credits for purchases of safe AI technology; (3)
escalating tax penalties for non-compliance; and (4) redistribution of penalty-
generated revenue to public safety research initiatives. This Article argues that such a
framework offers a practical solution for embedding safety considerations within the
economic architecture of AI development while preserving innovation incentives.
Through careful calibration of fiscal levers, public policy tools can address the
structural misalignment between private sector imperatives and public safety
demands in emerging technologies.

Introduction
The race to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI)—systems matching human performance
across diverse tasks—has become a defining technological pursuit of our era.1 As industry leaders
edge closer to this milestone, and even speculate about artificial superintelligence (ASI),2 the stakes
of AI safety grow considerably.3 How can we ensure that a system general enough to perform most
human tasks, a system that most expect to be socially transformative, will also not lead to unintended
accidents and harms on a massive scale?4 While private entities pour unprecedented resources into
advancing AI capabilities, investments in safety research languish, creating a quickly expanding
“safety-capability” gap.5 The consequences of the gap between what AI can do and what AI can can
do safely are not abstract: vulnerabilities in frontier systems—from susceptibility to adversarial
attacks to emergent misalignment with human values—threaten individual rights, democratic
institutions, and global stability. This divergence stems not from scientific impossibility of building
safer systems, but from structural incentives. The rewards of powerful AI flow to developers; the
risks cascade across society.
This Article argues that fiscal policy can play a key role in closing this gap. Building on Hemel
and Ouellette’s Innovation Policy Pluralism framework,6 which positions taxation as a critical yet
underutilized lever for steering technological progress, we propose a novel approach: embedding
safety imperatives directly into the economic architecture of AI development. Unlike traditional
regulation, which struggles to govern fast-evolving technologies through rigid mandates, tax

https://perma.cc/JE77-FK6D. The estimates of our distance to this poorly defined goal of AGI shift rapidly. In 2010, AGI
was predicted to be 50 years into the future; by 2023, this has shifted to 5-20 years. The most critical of industry leaders, Yann

incentives harness firm in-house knowledge while mitigating regulatory capture and expertise
asymmetries. By rewarding safety-aligned research, penalizing reckless capability acceleration, and
redistributing penalty revenue to public safety initiatives, a tax-based approach aligns private profit
motives with social welfare imperatives, without stifling innovation. And while the application of
this framework is novel, we demonstrate its political feasibility by drawing on extensive precedents
already embedded in the tax system.7
The urgency of this intervention is underscored by recent regulatory failures. On his first day in
office, President Trump revoked the executive order meant to control AI safety risks left by his
predecessor.8 Efforts at the state level have also been unavailing. The most ambitious of those,
California’s SB-1047, was vetoed by California governor Gavin Newsom.9 His veto concedes that
“[s]afety protocols must be adopted” and that “we cannot afford to wait for a major catastrophe to
occur before taking action to protect the public.”10 The problem, Newsom stated, was the lack of
sufficient “empirical trajectory analysis” to support the law.11 But the hopes for rigorous empirical
testing conflict directly with the reality that the technology is developed in breakneck speeds, behind
the curtain of AI labs, and involves opaque systems. Whatever empirical trajectory analysis means, it
is clear that no one had been able to produce one in the last few years, and the vetoing of regulatory
mechanisms like the California Bill undermines our ability to gather exactly this type of information.
Nor has self regulation proved robust. In 2023, OpenAI’s promoted a much-touted
“Superalignment” initiative—promising 20% of computing resources for safety research.12 This
initiative collapsed under competitive pressures, with internal reports revealing diverted GPU
allocations and hollow compliance.13 This pattern pervades the industry: safety teams operate on
7 In the pharmaceutical industry, for instance, tax credits for orphan drugs and safety-related research have successfully
encouraged firms to invest in underfunded areas like rare disease treatment, even when such investments are not immediately
profitable. 26 U.S.C. § 45C; Orphan Drug Act, Pub. L. No. 97-414, 96 Stat. 2049 (1983) (codified as amended at 21 U.S.C.
section 360cc). It also allowed unused credit to be offset past and future tax liability through carryback and carryforward
features. Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, Pub. L. 105-34, § 604, 111 Stat. 788, 863 (1997) (allowing carryback three years and
carry forward up to fifteen years). The use of the term “Orphan” refers to drugs for rare diseases and conditions that entail
limited opportunities for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to undertake their development and production. See
Orphan Drug Act, Pub. L. No. 97-414, section 1(b), 96 Stat. 2049, 2049 (1983) (providing an overview on the environment
of research in the area of rare conditions and diseases). Similarly, in aerospace, strict regulatory requirements coupled with
financial incentives for safety improvements have led to significant advancements in aircraft reliability and passenger safety.

shoestring budgets while capability divisions command vast resources. The root cause is clear. Under
current market and regulatory conditions, the incentives of firms are misaligned; safety might
produce public benefits, but it leeches resources firms would rather spend on the race to own the
most capable system.
While we view tax incentives as part of the solution, we note that currently tax instruments are
part of the problem.14 Research incentive mechanisms, such as R&D credits and expensing
provisions,15 exacerbate the misalignment by subsidizing capability research indiscriminately.16 Our
proposal confronts these challenges through three interlocking mechanisms: (1) producer-side
incentives, such as safety R&D credits and differentiated expensing that accelerates deductions for
safety research while amortizing pure capability investments; (2) consumer-side safety-linked tax
credits contingent on verifiable adherence to NIST or ISO benchmarks; and (3) Corrective tax
penalties scaled to the social cost of unsafe deployments, with revenues funding public-sector safety
consortia. 17
Tax agencies enjoy an important, if neglected, advantage in AI safety regulation: institutional
competence. The playing field in AI is tilted against regulators; any attempt to regulate, even if it
could overcome the lobby and political pressure to win the AI race, would still need to deal with the
reality that AI labs have vastly more funding, expertise, computing resources, and technical talent
than government agencies.18 Relative to other agencies, however, tax agencies possess established
competencies in auditing complex R&D claims, offering a foundation for effective oversight of tax-
based safety claims.19 This administrative framework can be enhanced through mandatory third-
party validation of safety benchmarks (e.g., adversarial safety scores, sandbox and red teaming
14 See infra Part II and III.C. See Lucy Colback, AI and the R&D Revolution, FIN. TIMES (Nov. 26, 2024),
https://perma.cc/JN32-NBUY (noting that while significant investments are made in R&D, the rapid pace of technological
advancement can lead to challenges in effectively managing and mitigating associated risks.).
15 Throughout, we use “research and development” and “research and experimentation” interchangeably, although we note
the latter is more restrictive than the former and does not necessarily specific immediate commercial applications. See Stephen
E. Shay, J. Clifton Fleming, Jr., & Robert J. Peroni, R&D Tax Incentives: Growth Panacea or Budget Trojan Horse?, 69 TAX
L. REV. 419, 422 n.15 (2016).
16 R&D credits are also criticized for favoring major private corporations that have the know-how relevant to exploiting these
credits. See, e.g., OECD, Measuring Tax Support for R&D and Innovation, OECD Science, Technology and Industry
Scoreboard (2017), https://perma.cc/Z32J-3ULJ (discussing the administrative challenges and potential inequities of R&D
tax incentives).
17 See, e.g., Paul A. David, Some New Standards for the Economics of Standardization in the Information Age, in ECONOMIC
POLICY AND TECHNOLOGICAL PERFORMANCE 206, 230 (Partha Dasgupta and Paul Stoneman eds. 1987) (discussing the public
good nature of basic research and the resulting underinvestment).
18 A tragi-comical case in point is Spain’s pioneering AI regulatory agency (AESIA), whose €5 million budget and 80-person
staff are comfortably ensconced in La Coruña – hundreds of miles away from the universities of Madrid or Barcelona. The
agency perfectly symbolizes Spain’s quixotic approach: seeking to lead the regulatory frontier across Europe without having a

artificial, pero será un país pionero en contar con su propia agencia dedicada a la inteligencia artificial”)
19 Tax R&D claims are mostly input-based. This increases the ease of verification for a non-expert, but because it also allows
for gaming, we do not recommend tax levers as a sole approach. See Part III.C. and infra notes 273-278 and accompanying

protocols, deployment simulations in controlled environments), systematic government audits, and
dynamic safety practice requirements.20 Such institutional mechanisms leverage existing
administrative expertise while establishing new protocols specifically calibrated to emerging
technological risks.21
These regulatory and self-regulatory failures underscore a fundamental and more general
challenge in emerging technology governance: the inadequacy of traditional oversight mechanisms
to address novel technological risks. This structural limitation demands theoretical innovation in
regulatory design, particularly in leveraging existing institutional frameworks that can better align
private incentives with public safety imperatives. Our theoretical framework advances the literature
on innovation policy instruments by demonstrating how tax policy can serve as a dynamic
mechanism for addressing novel technological risks.22 While existing scholarship has extensively
examined traditional regulatory approaches and direct incentive mechanisms, the theoretical utility
of tax instruments in governing emerging technologies remains underexplored.23
We build upon Hemel and Ouellette’s innovation policy pluralism framework to demonstrate
how tax policy’s unique institutional characteristics—including its scalability, built-in compliance

mechanisms, and capacity to leverage private expertise—make it particularly well-suited for
addressing the social misalignment problem in AI development.24 Our approach contributes to both
tax policy and technology governance literature by introducing a novel theoretical framework for
understanding how fiscal instruments can bridge the gap between private innovation incentives and
public safety imperatives.25 This framework’s utility derives from its ability to harness existing
administrative competencies while avoiding the information asymmetries and expertise gaps that
plague traditional command-and-control regulation.26 By conceptualizing safety investment as a tax-
mediated social good rather than merely a regulatory compliance issue, our model provides new
theoretical insights into how fiscal policy can shape technological development trajectories while
preserving innovation incentives.27
This Article proceeds as follows. Part I examines the urgency of AI safety, outlining the risks of
malicious misuse, accidental failures, and autonomous misalignments while positioning the
capability-safety gap as a core challenge. Part II explores how tax incentives have historically
addressed safety in other domains, such as energy, infrastructure, and occupational safety, offering
insights into existing fiscal mechanisms that could inform AI governance. In Part III, we propose a
novel tax framework for AI safety, detailing a system of producer incentives, consumer demand
stimulation, and corrective tax penalties. Taken together, those levers would work to embed safety
into the fabric of AI development, inculcate safety culture, and increase the ROI of safety
investments. We anticipate a number of administrative challenges inherent in implementing this
framework, including verification, enforcement, and compliance, and we draw on the special
competence of the tax system to offer a number of pragmatic mitigation strategies. The Conclusion
reflects on the broader implications of using fiscal levers to align private innovation with public
safety. In conversation with the innovation policy literature, the framework developed here offers a
blueprint for governing other emerging technologies, and can help in turning safety from a
regulatory inconvenience into an essential part of the R&D process itself.

I. The Importance of AI Safety
AI safety represents a distinct subfield of artificial intelligence research dedicated to developing
methodological frameworks, empirical standards, and technical safeguards to mitigate potential
harms from AI deployment to individuals, communities, and ecological systems.28 The field’s scope
stems from a fundamental premise about artificial intelligence: its tendency toward generality in
application creates correspondingly general vectors for potential harm.29 This characteristic calls for
a comprehensive approach to risk assessment and mitigation.30 In this Part, we first introduce the
general AI safety risk framework. Then, we offer a brief overview of the field, arguing that the field
has seen some modest progress, but it is uneven and lethargic. We locate the gap between capabilities
and safety as resulting from the social misalignment problem. Understanding the size of the gap thus
motivates our proposed solution framework.
A. An Outline of AI Safety
Contemporary scholarship has more-or-less coalesced around a tripartite taxonomy of safety
risks, providing an analytical framework for understanding the distinct yet interconnected
challenges in AI safety. This framework identifies three primary categories of risk: (1) intentional
misuse through malicious deployment, (2) accidental harm through unintended system behavior,
and (3) autonomous system actions that deviate from human values or intentions.31 Each category
presents distinct technical and governance challenges while sharing common underlying dynamics
related to system capability and control.32
Before examining these risks in detail, we should clarify the meaning of safety itself. The
literature has long recognized that it is important to ensure that AI systems will act in an ethical
manner.33 There has been a large wave of mature legal literature on ethical applications of AI in
settings like employment, credit extension, and parole decisions, where researchers have usefully

exposed issues of fairness, bias, and algorithmic blind spots.34 Safety research is likewise focused on
ethical application of AI, but with a more basic imperative: the mitigation of risks to life, physical
integrity, and fundamental autonomy.35
The category of malicious use illustrates the complexity of these safety challenges.36 Consider
recent demonstrations of AI systems’ capacity to aid in biological weapon design, the discovery of
software vulnerabilities (“0-day exploits”),37 or the potential for market manipulation through
automated trading systems.38 Some of these threats are not entirely novel: a well-resourced group
could accomplish them today. But even in these cases, advanced AI system provide what is known as
a “uplift” over existing methods,39 that is, they allow smaller groups, with lesser investment of
resources, to achieve more. The degree of uplift, as well as the discovery of novel attack vectors, is
directly correlated with the power of the underlying system.40
It is also worth noting that the designation of “malicious” use often depends on socio-political
context - what one actor views as defensive capability, another may view as an offensive threat. This
contextual dependency complicates the development of universal safety standards, and suggests that
some international negotiation would be necessary at some point. This complexity also appears in
the context dual-use scenarios, where AI systems developed for beneficial purposes can be
repurposed for harm.41 For instance, language models trained to assist in scientific research might be
used to generate misinformation, while computer vision systems designed for medical diagnosis
could be adapted for autonomous weapons targeting.42 These scenarios underscore the necessity of

developing safety measures that address not only technical capabilities but also deployment contexts
and potential misuse vectors.
The second category covers accidental risks arising from AI system deployment. While all
technological systems face operational risks, the expanding autonomy of AI systems in critical
infrastructure and decision-making contexts introduces novel vulnerabilities that go well beyond
conventional accident scenarios.43 As these systems assume greater control from human operators,
the nature and scope of potential accidents evolve in complexity and consequence.44 Consider AI
systems integrated into critical infrastructure networks. A system managing wastewater processing
or public water supplies must maintain operational integrity across numerous edge cases and
environmental variations.45 The interconnected nature of these systems amplifies risk – a cascading
failure could propagate across multiple infrastructure nodes with potentially severe consequences
for public health and safety.
A specific accident concern is known as system brittleness.46 Current AI architectures
demonstrate high performance within familiar domains where deployment conditions approximate
training environments.47 However, real-world deployment inevitably presents novel scenarios that
deviate from these controlled conditions, and the system may be brittle to such deviations. A traffic
management system optimized for standard vehicle patterns may encounter unprecedented
situations - from unusual road obstacles to emergency response scenarios - that fall outside its
training distribution. We already have evidence that such issues result in tragic consequences to life
and limb.48 Worse, for complex systems that had been trained on large amounts of data, it is hard to
know what falls within the system parameters and what falls outside of it.
This challenge is compounded by the interpretability obstacle in modern AI systems.49 While
their architectural principles are well-documented, the specific meanings and interactions of internal
parameters remain largely opaque.50 This “black box” characteristic severely constrains our ability to
audit system behavior or predict responses to novel stimuli. While we have made some progress on

interpretability or explainability, there is still a long way to go in understanding the systems’
internals.51
The third category of risk—autonomous behavior that deviates from human intent—represents
perhaps the most contentious and conceptually challenging domain of AI safety research.52 Public
discourse has focused primarily on language models’ conversational capabilities.53 This makes
autonomy feel remote and alien to the familiar way of interacting with AI. But behind the curtain,
in labs and on repositories, a more profound transformation is occurring in the development of
autonomous AI agents.54 These agentic systems, designed to pursue general objectives with minimal
human oversight, represent a qualitative shift in AI capabilities and associated risks.55
To provide a general sense of the current frameworks (remembering that this field is fast
changing), autonomous agents are defined primarily by their agency, that is, the ability to take action
in the pursuit of a given goal.56 In the simplest framework, an agent would be given a task of finding
a table in a Mexican restaurant for two people. It would identify the intention of the user, chart
strategies (locate relevant restaurants, verify that they are open, and make a reservation), and then
execute the plan. Without user involvement, the agent would open a browser to search for relevant
restaurants, use text messages or even a phone to call the relevant restaurants, and then report back
on its success or failure in the mission. More elaborate frameworks involve multiple agents, and use
a hierarchical architecture of task decomposition and delegation.57 When assigned a broad
objective—such as planning an international vacation—the primary agent generates sub-goals and
instantiates specialized sub-agents to pursue them.58 These sub-agents might collect meteorological
data, optimize travel logistics, or identify strategies for accessing popular attractions. The system

maintains coherence through periodic synchronization between sub-agents and the central planning
agent, creating a distributed but coordinated pursuit of the primary objective.59
The capability boundary of these agents extends far beyond mere information processing.
Modern AI agents possess significant operational tools, including internet access, financial
transaction capabilities, high fidelity text-to-speech models, and even the ability to hire humans.60 If
there is one thing that observers of current systems tend to miss is the breadth of these tools, and so
they often wrongly conclude that language models pose little risk to the outside world, as they cannot
perform physical tasks or navigate the CAPTCHA system.61 The empirical evidence, however,
suggests these constraints are quite permeable. In a notable demonstration, an AI agent
circumvented a CAPTCHA barrier by (proposing to) recruit and compensate a human worker
through a digital labor platform, presenting itself as a visually impaired user requiring assistance.62
This example illustrates a broader pattern: through creative recombination of available tools and
services, AI agents can effectively transcend apparent operational constraints.
This capability for creative problem-solving, while impressive, introduces profound safety
concerns. As Bostrom has argued, autonomous systems may pursue designated objectives through
unanticipated and potentially harmful pathways.63 The agent’s solution to the CAPTCHA problem
demonstrates what Eliezer Yudkowsky, a leading researcher at the Machine Intelligence Research
Institute, terms “optimization pressure”—the tendency of AI systems to find unexpected solutions
that satisfy formal objectives while potentially violating implicit constraints or human values.64
Even systems with limited degree of autonomy have displayed worrisome and unexpected
patterns. In a notable instance, OpenAI’s O1 model was tested on its ability to exploit a server to
locate a hidden key; when the isolated test environment failed due to a bug, the AI unexpectedly
gained access to the host system outside its container.65Or consider an AI system designed to play the
game of Diplomacy which learned to engage in premediated deception: playing as France, it secretly
planned with Germany to betray England, while telling England it has its support.66 This suggests
that safeguards built around limited tool access could still fail in unanticipated ways.

Overall, the autonomy of these systems introduces novel vectors for potential harm that
transcend traditional safety frameworks.67 Unlike conventional software systems, autonomous
agents can: (i) Independently formulate and pursue sub-goals (ii) Identify and exploit novel
pathways for goal achievement (iii) Interact with and manipulate human systems and institutions
(iv) scale their impact through recursive self-improvement or coordination with other agents. These
capabilities, combined with the inherent difficulty of specifying complete and robust objective
functions, create a difficult problem of effective control and supervision.
B. The Capability-Safety Gap
AI development has historically followed cyclical patterns of advancement and regression,
commonly termed “summers” and “winters” in the field.68 We are undeniably experiencing a
significant “summer” period now, characterized by unprecedented progress in model capabilities,
though the duration and sustainability of this trend remains uncertain.
The figure illustrates a crucial pattern in contemporary AI development through standardized
performance metrics across multiple domains.69 The horizontal dashed line represents human-level
performance on various cognitive tasks, providing a natural benchmark for AI capability evaluation.
The trajectories demonstrate three distinct phases of progress: initial sub-human performance, rapid
advancement toward human parity, and in many cases, progression to super-human capabilities.

Consider image classification, a foundational task in computer vision. In 2012, state-of-the-art
systems achieved approximately 85% of human-level performance. The field then experienced
dramatic acceleration, reaching human parity within three years. By 2021, these systems consistently
surpassed human performance by significant margins. Similar trajectories appear in visual reasoning
and reading comprehension tasks, suggesting a generalizable pattern of capability development.70
Perhaps most telling is something missing from the figure. Several performance metrics stop
reporting progress post 2021. They stop not because of lack of progress in AI capabilities—indeed,
we know there was immense progress over the last four years— but rather the exhaustion of these
metrics’ utility. Put differently, modern systems achieve accuracy rates so high that these
benchmarks no longer effectively discriminate between model improvements. This phenomenon is
known as benchmark saturation, and researchers around the world are working to develop new ways
to measure the performance of novel AI systems.71
The capability progression stands in stark contrast to our ability to measure and ensure system
safety. Autonomous vehicles provide the most concrete domain for safety assessment, benefiting
from a century of human driving data and what one would expect to be easily measurable safety
outcomes. However, even here, measurement challenges persist.72 Companies employ disparate
metrics and varying levels of autonomy, complicating comparative analysis.73 Despite massive
investment, fully autonomous deployment remains limited to restricted geographic areas under
remote supervision.74
More concerning are the gaps in our safety metrics.75 We lack robust measures for critical
vulnerabilities such as susceptibility to adversarial attacks or systemic failure modes.76 For instance,
while we can measure basic operational safety in ideal conditions, we have limited understanding of
system resilience to edge cases like unusual atmospheric conditions or coordinated environmental

perturbations (think a rare eclipse or a blue moon). This limitation is particularly problematic given
the increasing deployment of AI systems in critical infrastructure and decision-making contexts.77
Recent high-profile cases underscore these safety challenges. For instance, leading AI labs, such
as Google and Meta, have vested interest in presenting to the public models that are friendly and
follow social conventions of etiquette. To that end, they invest tremendous amounts of computing
resources and training ingenuity to install guardrails into their models, such that they will not
produce embarrassing outputs.78 But as is well publicized, these all failed at launch or were easily
circumvented.79 This is far from obvious: the biggest corporations, with billions of PR images on the
line, failed to make a model that would not tell their customer to “Please die.”80
Overall, the harsh lesson is this: there is a gap between capabilities and safety, and this gap –
which we do not even know how to properly measure – seems to widen and grow. This opens the
question: why does the gap exist?
C. The Social Misalignment Problem
The yawning capability-safety gap, coupled with the magnitude of potential harm from
insufficiently secured high-capability systems, elevates AI safety from a technical imperative to a
critical social priority.81 As artificial intelligence systems penetrate core societal functions—from
healthcare delivery and economic governance to national security infrastructure—the absence of
robust safety protocols threatens not only operational integrity but social stability itself.82 The
potential consequences range from discrete harms to individuals to systemic disruptions that could
undermine institutional resilience and public welfare.83

While developers of frontier AI systems consistently articulate commitment to safety protocols,
the incentive architecture surrounding development creates persistent misalignment between
expressed values and operational priorities.84 Obviously, firms do care about safety to the extent it
can affect their market share, and developers have their own safety in mind when they train and
deploy models. However, this orientation may well prove insufficient against the structural forces
shaping development trajectories, as learned from many historical lethal accidents.85 The
fundamental asymmetry lies in the reward distribution: the potential returns from developing
advanced AI capabilities—whether through general artificial intelligence or domain-specific
breakthroughs—are concentrated, while the risks are diffused.
Contributing to this basic misalignment are three important facts; many of the potential harms
from AI deployment are probabilistic, temporally displaced, and often difficult to attribute directly
to system design choices.86 Moreover, developers face a pernicious collective action problem: there is
a growing race between China and the US and competitive dynamics punish those who move slowly
(and carefully).87 This dynamic intersects with the prevalent “move fast and break things” ethos of
technology entrepreneurship, creating institutional environments where safety considerations,
despite their acknowledged importance, struggle to constrain development velocities.88 The result is
a form of structural capture—even developers who prioritize safety find themselves navigating
between competitive pressures for rapid capability advancement and the cultural imperatives of
technology entrepreneurship.89
Even if firms could overcome internal incentive gaps, the safety challenge is broad and
demanding, as AI are vulnerable to multiple attack vectors.90 Adversarial attacks can compromise
system integrity through various mechanisms, from perturbation of visual recognition systems to

it prioritized profits over accident costs.

prompt injection and jailbreaks, with implications that range from localized service disruption to
potential systemic failures in critical infrastructure.91
The challenge of ensuring system safety is further complicated by emergent capabilities: when
“the system suddenly develops a significant new capability or character after a relatively small and
gradual change in some of the system’s parts or features.”92 Lab experiments reveal that models
engage in scheming and deceptive behaviors that not only were not preprogrammed, but that require
effort to weed out. 93 This emergent behavior pattern becomes more pronounced as systems increase
in scale and capability—creating what we might term an “emergence-safety paradox”—the very
architectural developments that enable enhanced capabilities simultaneously increase the probability
of unexpected and potentially harmful behaviors.94 Yet, despite known deficiencies, AI labs proceed
with public deployment, commercialization, and often grandiose capability claims.95
Overall, the social misalignment of incentives between labs and long-term social interests is a
cause for continued concern. Fortunately, once misalignment emerges as a diagnosis, it also suggests
a diagnosis. The subsequent Part will illustrate how tax levers are well positioned to close the
misalignment gap and enhance AI safety investments through incentives and penalties, while
preserving an optimal level of investment in innovation.

Investments in Safety
The government supports innovation in a variety of ways: tax incentives, subsidies, grants,
prizes, patents, purchase agreements, and support of basic research in universities, to name but a few.

the proposal to use fiscal levers to enhance safety research and innovation, our goal in this Part is to
collect three important examples of government safety support.
As we show, government support for safety includes various direct and indirect subsidies meant
to promote investments in precautionary measures and safety improvements.97 Direct subsidies can
include grants and prizes while indirect subsidies often take the form of tax credits or deductions
specifically targeted at safety-related expenditures.98 For example, organizations may receive tax
credits for developing and implementing safety protocols,99 conducting safety audits,100 or acquiring
certifications that ensure compliance with regulatory standards.101 These measures lower the
effective cost of adopting safety enhancements, encouraging businesses to integrate them into their
operations.102 Such subsidies not only support industries in increasing the quality of their products
but also contribute to societal well-being by ensuring that safety is prioritized in areas such as
infrastructure, healthcare, and technology development.103 These measures lay the groundwork for
our proposal in the next Part.
A. Energy & Infrastructure Safety
The most direct tax incentive promoting investment in energy-efficient equipment is accelerated
depreciation,104 which permits businesses to allocate a greater portion of an asset’s cost to deductions
in its earlier years rather than spreading the expense evenly across its useful life.105 By advancing these
deductions, accelerated depreciation reduces short-term taxable income, enhancing cash flow and

facilitating reinvestment opportunities.106 For safety applications depreciation is especially
important, as safety risks can span many years, and the depreciation leads to greater safety
investments.107
Tax policy also employs indirect measures through exemptions or reduced rates on public safety-
related goods and services—including smoke detectors, cybersecurity tools, and renewable energy
systems.108 These demand-side tax incentives encourage widespread consumer adoption of safety
measures.109 Such indirect methods create multiplicative effects, fostering safety culture across
sectors without explicit mandates. 110 This dual approach demonstrates how tax systems can serve as
versatile tools for promoting societal well-being by leveraging fiscal incentives for both producers
and consumers to drive meaningful behavioral changes at organizational and individual levels.111
The energy-efficient commercial buildings deduction and residential energy efficiency tax credit
exemplify this simultaneous supply-and-demand approach.112 For businesses, the commercial
buildings deduction provides supply-side benefits through reduced taxable income for energy-
efficient system investments, encouraging widespread adoption of technologies that reduce energy
consumption and operational costs.113 For individuals, the residential tax credit functions as a

demand-side incentive by directly offsetting energy-efficient system installation costs. 114 At the firm
level, accelerated depreciation and tax credits enhance safety by incentivizing energy-efficient
commercial building upgrades, which frequently yield significant safety improvements. This dual
targeting of business and individual needs creates a comprehensive approach to promoting
sustainability, safety, and resilience.
The Advanced Energy Project Credit further illustrates these mechanisms, offering up to 30%
credit for qualifying manufacturing investments in: (i) facilities that produce or recycle through
green energy methods, (ii) facilities designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, and (iii)
facilities for processing, refining or recycling critical materials.115 Notable qualifying projects
encompass electric grid modernization, carbon capture and storage systems, electric/hybrid/fuel cell
vehicles, low- or zero-carbon process heat systems, and equipment reducing industrial process
waste.116
These systems deliver multiple safety benefits beyond energy efficiency.117 They enhance fire
safety, minimize hazardous material risks, and improve extreme weather protection. 118 For instance,
improved insulation provides more effective indoor temperature regulation, reducing health risks
from extreme temperatures. Upgraded electrical systems decrease electrical fire likelihood, while
modernized HVAC systems enhance air circulation and quality, reducing harmful pollutant and
allergen exposure. 119 Collectively, these improvements create safer, healthier building environments
while advancing energy efficiency goals.

B. Environmental and Road Safety
In the environmental protection’s context, various federal agencies support innovation related
to offshore drilling safety through technology, assessment, and research program as well as
operational, safety, and engineering research program.120 Similarly, the investment tax credit for
solar energy exemplifies the dual-purpose design of modern tax incentives.121 While its primary
objective is to encourage the adoption of renewable energy, the investment credit also contributes to
fire safety improvements through the installation of safer, more modern energy systems.122 Even
consumer-focused incentives, such as the electric vehicle (EV) tax credit, demonstrate how tax policy
can integrate safety and sustainability.123 By reducing the cost barrier for purchasing EVs, these
credits drive demand for vehicles equipped with advanced safety features, including automated
braking systems and enhanced structural designs, and—critically—vehicles that are environment
friendly.124 Similarly, the Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit, aimed at businesses and tax-exempt
organizations, provides a credit for vehicles that are considered safer on the roads.125 Together, these
incentives reflect a growing trend in tax policy: leveraging economic benefits to encourage broader
societal gains, such as energy efficiency, safety, and environmental responsibility.
How does the government fund such programs? Typically, it does so through a combination of
budgetary reallocations and revenue generation mechanisms, such as excise taxes.126 Budgetary
120 The U.S. Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) administers the
Technology Assessment Program (TAP) and the Engineering Technology Assessment Center (ETAC), both of which support
research and technological assessments to enhance offshore drilling safety. These programs focus on operational safety,
environmental protection, and the evaluation of emerging technologies in offshore oil and natural gas exploration and
development. See generally https://perma.cc/7PQN-FF9G.

adjustments involve redirecting public funds from general revenues or other sectors to finance
targeted programs, ensuring the availability of resources without necessarily increasing the overall
tax burden.127 This approach often reflects a prioritization of policy goals, such as sustainability or
safety, within the existing fiscal framework.128 Additionally, the government may impose or increase
excise taxes on specific goods or activities to generate dedicated funding for these programs.129
For example, the federal fuel excise tax is perhaps the most prominent example of tax policy that
affects road safety and infrastructure.130 The federal government places the taxes collected on
purchases of fuel into the Highway Trust Fund, which funds the construction, maintenance, and
safety improvements of highways and bridges.131 While all improvements to highway and
transportation infrastructure contribute to overall safety, the Highway Trust Fund supports a range
of programs expressly dedicated to reducing traffic fatalities and injuries through targeted safety
measures and initiatives.132 These programs include, but are not limited to, the Highway Safety
Improvement Program133, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Program134, and the
Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration Program135, to name a few. Programs like these address

safety-related issues such as better signage, traffic management systems, and safer road designs.136
Similar mechanisms function in the context of workplace and occupational safety.
C. Workplace and Occupational Safety
Tax policy employs multiple mechanisms to promote workplace safety through equipment and
practice investments across sectors. The disaster tax relief provides benefits in federally declared
disaster areas, including deductions for safety measures and rebuilding. 137 Similarly, disabled access
credits support businesses implementing safety improvements like accessible exits and enhanced
emergency systems. 138 The Advanced Energy Project Credit exemplifies direct safety enhancement
through electric grid modernization, reducing risks of power outages, electrical fires, arc flash
incidents, and equipment malfunctions.139
Capital investments in workplace equipment and technology yield multiple safety benefits.
Newer work vehicles exemplify this dynamic, featuring enhanced safety technologies, improved
reliability, and contributions to healthier ambient air quality in and around facilities.140 Similar
environmental and safety improvements arise from investments in oil-spill prevention equipment,
low or zero-carbon process heat systems and carbon recapture technology, which enhance ambient

air quality conditions. 141 Indeed, general technological modernization in workplace settings achieves
both direct and indirect safety enhancements through updated equipment and improved
manufacturing processes.142
The tax code promotes these safety-enhancing investments through accelerated cost recovery
mechanisms. Immediate expensing—representing the most aggressive form of depreciation
available—permits businesses to write off up to $1.25 million of qualifying property costs, with
deductions phasing out dollar-for-dollar once total purchases exceed $3.13 million.143 While this
mechanism does not explicitly target safety-related expenditures, it enables immediate deduction of
qualifying new and used equipment and facility purchases. 144 These deductions, though limited to
taxable income, can carry forward to subsequent years under the same income and dollar
constraints.145 This accelerated expensing of new equipment and safety infrastructure—including
fire protection and security systems—incentivizes businesses to prioritize safety enhancements,
potentially reducing workplace hazards and improving overall safety conditions. 146
Bonus depreciation provides another significant tax incentive mechanism, allowing an 80%
immediate deduction of property costs in the service year, encompassing safety-oriented equipment
like protective gear and safety guards.147 The provision covers a broad spectrum of qualifying
property: tangible assets, computer software, qualified improvements, and nonresidential real
property enhancements including critical safety infrastructure like HVAC, fire protection, and
security systems.148 This mechanism complements immediate expensing by enabling additional
deductions beyond standard expensing limits, thus accelerating cost recovery and indirectly
promoting investments in newer, inherently safer equipment and facilities.149

incentives to drive investments in clean energy, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, all the while

promoting safe work practices.150 These incentives operate through a two-tier structure: the act
provides a base credit for eligible projects and a bonus credit for those meeting additional
requirements, such as adhering to prevailing wage standards and apprenticeship programs.151 For
example, a renewable energy project installing solar panels could receive a 6% investment tax credit,
which increases to 30% if labor and apprenticeship conditions are met.152 Another mechanism is
training requirement for apprentices by journeymen, which is meant to promote the training and
development of a skilled workforce, further enhancing workplace safety standards.153
D. Safety Research Incentives
While the preceding analysis examined tax incentives for implementing existing safety
technologies, a distinct challenge emerges in the domain of fundamental safety research. Innovation
drives long-term economic growth and living standard improvements, with research and
development (R&D) serving as the cornerstone of sustained technological progress. 154 However, this
domain exhibits a classic market failure: social returns from research, particularly in fundamental
areas characterized by uncertainty and non-rivalry, vastly exceed private returns.155 This disparity
creates a compelling case for government intervention, especially as the U.S. research funding
landscape has shifted dramatically toward private sector dominance, with businesses now
conducting more than two-thirds of all U.S. R&D activities. 156
The tax system has historically addressed this market failure through two primary mechanisms:
immediate R&D expensing and the R&D tax credit. Until recently, federal policy permitted full,

immediate deductions for R&D expenditures to encourage private sector investment.157 However,
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 mandated five-year amortization for domestic research (fifteen
years for foreign research), potentially deterring R&D investment, particularly among resource-
constrained firms.158
The R&D credit, introduced in 1981, aims to incentivize increased research investment rather
than merely subsidizing existing R&D activities.159 The credit offers multiple pathways: a traditional
20% credit for qualified expenses above a base amount,160 an alternative simplified 14% credit,161 an
energy research credit (20% flat rate),162 and a basic research credit for university collaboration.163
The Basic Research credit guarantees same advantages to companies when they outsource scientific
research and engage in collaborations with universities.164 In addition to the federal credit,

approximately 35 states have a research tax credit.165 The latest tax spending report from the Joint

are part of the process to develop new technology or prove feasibility.171 However, trials conducted
for routine market testing or compliance are generally excluded.172 This means that quality assurance
activities, including post-market safety testing and compliance verification, generally fall outside the
definition of qualified research expenses unless part of new technology development. 173 This creates
a significant gap: existing incentives not only fail to prioritize AI safety research but may actually
discourage such investment by providing equal or greater inducements for less safety-oriented
innovation.
III. A Tax Framework for Safe AI Development
The preceding analysis illuminates a critical market failure in AI development: while private
entities capture the benefits of capability advances, the risks and potential harms are broadly
socialized. This misalignment creates systematic underinvestment in safety research and protocols
relative to capability development. Current tax frameworks, particularly R&D incentives,
exacerbate rather than ameliorate this dynamic by subsidizing capability research without
differentiating safety-oriented initiatives. We propose leveraging fiscal policy to address this market
failure through a tripartite framework that builds upon established precedents in energy efficiency,
workplace safety, and environmental protection.174 By integrating producer-side safety incentives,
market-based certification mechanisms, and corrective tax measures, our approach harnesses existing
administrative competencies while addressing the unique challenges of emerging AI systems.
Importantly, all of these proposals are grounded in practices already employed, albeit in a diffused
manner, by the tax system, and so they draw on existing institutional competencies.
171 But See Thomson Reuters, Section 174 Expenditures: What Qualifies and What Doesn’t, Thomson Reuters Tax &
Accounting, https://perma.cc/4FV5-HBKA (explaining that quality control testing does not qualify as a research and
experimental expense under Section 174).
172 See 26 C.F.R. §1.174-2(a)(3) (disallowing section 174 treatment for certain activities, including: ordinary testing or
inspection of materials or products for quality control, efficiency surveys, management studies, consumer surveys, advertising

or similar projects.).

IRC § 41—Qualified Research Activities, IRS.gov, https://perma.cc/8QV8-R5WY (disallowing “section 174 treatment for
certain activities for ordinary testing or inspection of materials or products for quality control”).
174 It is an open-ended question how much money should be spent on reducing AI risks; the primary if initial attempt to answer
this question offers a qualified estimate of 8% of GDP, which would amount to a stunning 2 trillion per year. Charles I. Jones,
How Much Should We Spend to Reduce A.I.’s Existential Risk? (Jan. 26, 2025) (unpublished manuscript), available at
https://perma.cc/BUW6-UAQW. But we do not take a positive stance on this question other than to note that there are strong
reasons to spend considerable amounts on encouraging safety.

A Novel Incentive, Allocation, and Distribution Mechanism
Hemel and Ouellette identified a critical insight for technology governance: the critical
importance of regulatory pluralism.175 Traditional regulatory measures, such as liability rules, fines,
and audits, respond to accidents after they happen. In contrast, tax levers like credits, deductions,
and accelerated depreciation push forms to invest in preventive measures, weaving safety into their
core culture and strategic planning. Together, both have ex-ante effects, contributing to what some
have called the “Swiss cheese” model of safety, where it is recognized that safety depends not on the
perfection of any specific security ‘slice,’ but rather by the stacking of several imperfect slices.176 The
balanced pluralistic approach likewise recognizes that no single tool can singlehandedly solve AI’s
risks, but taken together they make safety both imperative and economically viable for firms.
By linking tax benefits directly to verifiable AI safety expenditures—such as workforce training,
alignment research, and safer product design—the government spurs private investment and helps
American labs stay competitive in the heating global AI race.177 These incentives reduce the cost of
building robust safety features, encourage proactive measures, and ensure that safety becomes an
organizational priority rather than an afterthought. While precise quantification of safety benefits
remains challenging and would require time to develop, delaying implementation until perfect
information becomes available would effectively privilege capability development. The framework
thus calls for baseline incentives now, combined with flexible mechanisms to refine these incentives
as our understanding of AI safety matures.
1. Business Tax-Incentives for Investments in AI Safety
Research incentives constitute a critical yet underutilized governance mechanism for advancing
AI safety protocols through strategically calibrated fiscal interventions. These instruments operate
through three distinct channels—research credits, expensing rules, and basic research incentives—
each addressing specific market failures in safety-oriented research and development.178 By
systematically modifying the underlying cost structure of safety research, targeted tax credits can
catalyze investment across crucial technical domains, including: (1) alignment research and
verification methodologies, (2) adversarial robustness testing and validation, and (3) interpretability
frameworks and monitoring systems.179 This tripartite approach leverages existing administrative

outcome. Usually, this can happen only when the holes in many layers momentarily line up”).

competencies while addressing the systematic underinvestment in safety research that characterizes
current AI development trajectories.
The pharmaceutical sector offers an instructive comparative framework. Contemporary
pharmaceutical R&D expenditures are directed toward both novel therapeutic discovery and
rigorous safety validation through clinical trials—activities that generate pure public goods in the
form of generalizable knowledge. The existing R&D tax credit and Basic Research credit frameworks
create targeted incentives for broad research initiatives,180 while specialized mechanisms like the
Orphan Drug tax credit address specific market failures in rare disease research.181 This regulatory
architecture demonstrates the potential for precisely targeted fiscal interventions to address
systematic underinvestment in socially beneficial research domains.
Current R&D credit qualification criteria present significant limitations for AI safety research.
Routine data collection, cleaning, and processing, as well as the implementation of existing AI tools
without experimentation, are currently considered operational activities and excluded.182 The
exclusions extend systematically across multiple domains: research conducted outside the U.S., third-
party funded research, market research costs, legal compliance expenses, infrastructure investments
(like GPUs or cloud computing), general employee training, quality assurance testing, and aesthetic
or interface design without technical uncertainty resolution.183
The case for similar interventions in AI safety is particularly compelling given the technology’s
universal impact radius.184 Unlike pharmaceutical products which primarily affect direct consumers,
AI systems generate broad externalities affecting both users and non-users through their societal
deployment and network effects.185 We propose adapting the pharmaceutical model to create an “AI
Safety Research Tax Credit” modeled after the Orphan Drug Credit.186 This credit would reward
expanded types of safety-oriented research activities including red team testing, explainability
180 See 26 U.S.C. § 41(a), (e). The Basic Research Credit offers for-profit firms a similar tax credit for payments made to
nonprofit organizations for their collaborative research. 26 U.S.C. § 41(e)(6). See generally MICHAEL D. RASHKIN, RESEARCH

requirements, training monitoring methodologies, and robust guardrail systems.187 Operating
through direct reduction of tax liability, the credit will create immediate financial benefits for firms
prioritizing AI safety research, including a structure benefiting firms that lack scale, scope, and age.188
The framework could implement differentiated credit rates across research phases. During
quality assurance and testing phases, elevated credit rates (e.g., 50% for startups, 25% for established
firms) would create enhanced incentives for thorough safety validation. This temporal variation in
credit rates reflects the particular importance of safety verification in later development stages.
Moreover, the Basic Research Credit could be redesigned to specifically encourage research
institutions and public-private partnerships to focus on investigating AI safety. Such targeted
incentives would foster collaborations between academic institutions, independent research
organizations, and private companies to address critical challenges in AI safety through development
of safety protocols, algorithmic robustness studies, and risk mitigation strategies.189
A second proposed mechanism leverages expensing rules to create differentiated business
incentives between safety and capability investments. Expensing rules significantly influence
corporate behavior and tax compliance, 190 with accelerated depreciation reducing complexity while
incentivizing investment.191 Currently, businesses can claim deductions under Section 168 (bonus
depreciation) or Section 179 (immediate expensing) for AI products meeting eligibility
requirements. Bonus depreciation enables 50% first-year cost deduction for tangible property rather
than following statutory recovery periods,192 with AI-related hardware (servers, GPUs, edge devices)
typically qualifying for 5-7 year depreciation schedules.193
We propose expanding this framework to permit immediate expensing of qualified safety-related
expenditures while mandating extended amortization periods for pure capability investments. This
dual approach creates complementary incentives: reducing effective costs for safety investments
through immediate deductibility of research, testing protocols, and monitoring systems, while
encouraging longer-term stability considerations through extended amortization requirements for

capability-focused investments.194 The framework would qualify safety-oriented investments—
including testing frameworks, alignment research, and monitoring systems—for immediate
expensing, while requiring longer depreciation or amortization for investments purely targeting
increased model size or computational capacity. This preferential treatment extends to development
costs like software, prototypes, licenses, and patents that would otherwise face extended
amortization periods. The extended amortization period for capability investments serves as a
natural brake on the “move fast and break things” mentality that has characterized much of AI
development, subtly reshaping organizational decision-making toward more responsible and
sustainable practices.
A significant challenge emerges from the current tax treatment of AI systems themselves. Under
existing law, while tangible components like servers and GPUs qualify for bonus depreciation,195
custom-developed AI software must typically be amortized over 15 years as an intangible asset. This
extended amortization period is said to significantly impede financial returns for companies
investing in innovation such as AI systems. 196 To address this barrier, we propose extending
immediate expensing benefits to certified safe AI systems. Rather than waiting many years to recover
development costs, companies that meet rigorous safety certification standards would qualify for
immediate deduction of their AI software development expenses. This modification creates a
powerful incentive for safety-conscious development while reducing the financial burden on
companies committed to responsible AI practices.
The framework can be further enhanced through strategic use of payroll tax deductibility.197
Recent proposals advocate increasing the maximum payroll tax liability offset by the R&D credit,
raising gross receipts eligibility barriers, and extending the startup claim period from four to eight
years.198 Making the credit refundable would particularly benefit high-tech industries and firms
lacking scale, scope, and age—entities that often lack the financial sophistication to navigate complex

195 Servers and GPUs qualify for bonus depreciation under IRC § 168(k) and Section 179 expensing because they are classified
as tangible personal property with a recovery period of 5 years under MACRS, making them eligible for accelerated

R&D documentation requirements.199 This modification would make the AI safety research credit
more accessible to startup enterprises with limited income tax obligations by providing immediate
liquidity through payroll tax refunds, including Medicare and unemployment insurance
payments.200
The Basic Research Credit framework offers a promising mechanism for advancing
foundational AI safety research.201 Unlike conventional R&D credits that primarily incentivize
applied research with clear commercial trajectories, the Basic Research Credit specifically targets
fundamental scientific inquiry devoid of immediate profit potential.202 This structural alignment
between credit design and the public goods characteristics of AI safety research warrants systematic
examination. The institutional framework established through basic research payments—defined as
transfers from corporations to qualified educational or tax-exempt organizations pursuant to
written agreements—creates a structured mechanism for systematic knowledge generation. 203 While
the existing calculation methodology introduces complexity to an already intricate incentive system,
this complexity serves crucial policy objectives.204 The differentiated treatment of basic research
reflects its distinctive characteristics: extended temporal horizons, heightened uncertainty
coefficients, and more diffuse societal benefits relative to applied research paradigms.205
We therefore propose expanding this framework to create a specialized “Basic AI Safety Research
Credit.” This mechanism would preserve the essential architectural features of the basic research
credit—particularly its emphasis on pre-commercial investigation—while incorporating specific
provisions for AI safety research. The proposed credit would incentivize formal research
partnerships between commercial AI developers and qualified research institutions, establishing
structured channels for knowledge transfer and collaborative investigation. This institutional

arrangement deliberately leverages proven complementary organizational capabilities: commercial
entities contribute practical expertise and computational infrastructure, while academic institutions
provide theoretical depth and commitment to open scientific inquiry.206
However, significant limitations exist in current basic tax credit qualification criteria for AI
safety research.207 These exclusions span multiple domains: non-technological activities like ethical
studies and market research; research collaborations conducted outside the U.S.; 208 funded research
where funding parties retain substantial rights; routine data collection and quality assurance
testing;209 administrative and managerial costs related to safety project oversight; capital
expenditures for fixed assets;210 personnel training costs; implementation of safety measures without
experimentation; system improvements lacking technical uncertainty resolution; and legal, patent,
marketing, and customer support efforts.211 These exclusions systematically constrain the
development of comprehensive safety frameworks.
The preceding analysis illuminates the diverse array of fiscal mechanisms within the existing tax
framework that can be mobilized to promote safe AI development while requiring minimal systemic
adaptation. From basic research credits to targeted safety incentives, these instruments leverage
established institutional architectures and administrative competencies to address the critical market
inefficiencies of underinvestment in AI safety research. While implementation presents certain
administrative and operational challenges—explored in subsequent sections—none proves
insurmountable, suggesting the framework’s viability as a governance mechanism for promoting
responsible AI development. As the discussion transitions to examining precise targeting
mechanisms for safe AI practices, it becomes crucial to consider how fiscal incentives can be
calibrated to advance genuine safety objectives rather than merely accelerating technological

capabilities, thereby addressing the fundamental challenge of closing the capability-safety gap in AI
development.
2. Spurring Consumer Demand for Safe & Reliable AI Products
On the individual consumer and household side, a tax credit could be created for purchasing AI
products certified as reliable and safe, similar to the existing Energy Efficient Home Improvement
Credit.212 The new “AI Reliability Credit” would incentivize producers to certify, and consumers to
invest in, AI technologies that meet rigorous safety and reliability standards, such as mitigating bias,
protecting user data, or operating transparently. This fiscal apparatus will provide a credit equal to
a 30% of the costs of “qualified AI reliable products” like smart home devices, AI-powered personal
assistants, or other consumer-facing AI applications that have been certified by approved regulatory
or independent organizations for meeting AI reliability and safety benchmarks.
The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit allows manufacturers to certify their products
for the energy-efficient tax credit by providing a Manufacturer’s Certification Statement confirming
their product meets IRS requirements.213 The mechanism for an AI Reliability Credit would mirror
this process. Domestic AI producers will provide certification for their eligible products and label
them with an “AI Reliability” mark to inform consumers of their qualification for the credit. At the
time of purchase, individuals would retain documentation such as receipts and certification details
to claim the credit on their annual tax returns and in case of IRS audit.214 The credit amount could
be a percentage of the purchase price, capped at a reasonable maximum per product or household
produced in the U.S.. For example, a $3,000 credit cap for an AI-certified product could encourage
adoption without significantly impacting the federal budget.215 By making AI reliability an appealing
and salient factor for consumers, the AI Reliability Credit would not only promote safer AI products
locally but also drive international market competition toward higher standards of safety.216
These proposed measures will be tied to the certifications mentioned earlier from independent
organizations in collaboration with regulatory bodies that establish clear and robust standards for
AI safety. For example, customized AI products designed while investing in way to mitigate bias,
prevent misuse, or enhance transparency could qualify for the tax incentive if they meet the

certification requirements.217 By rewarding companies that invest in safety and ethical AI practices,
this policy could drive widespread adoption of responsible AI practices across industries.218 Thus,
through shifting consumer demand, this measure could align private firm incentives with broader
societal goals of ensuring AI systems are safe, reliable, and beneficial to users. As consumer demand
for safe and reliable AI products grows, it becomes equally important to consider implementing
Pigouvian levers for unsafe AI development and practices to ensure accountability and deter harmful
behaviors.
3. Penalizing Unsafe AI Development
Parties that engage in unsafe behavior sometimes externalize the risk to other parties.219 A
standard solution, due to Pigou, is the use of corrective tax measures in situations where markets do
not satisfactorily resolve these issues. 220 Corrective taxes are meant to impose the external cost on
those who engage in unsafe behaviors, and thus “internalize” the harm they create.221 Unlike the
command-and-control approach, penalties grants the regulated party the freedom to decide if, how
much, and how to participate in the regulated activity.222 For example, in the case of pollution-
causing actions there is a uniform rate or fees are imposed on polluters for them to internalize their
actions .223
Legal scholars have shown the utility of corrective taxes to encourage safety. Cass Sunstein, for
example, has proposed implementing a tax on hazardous workplaces within the framework of
workplace safety to enhance the effectiveness of OSHA standards.224 Similarly, Jonathan Masur and
Eric Posner propose imposing taxes as the optimal method for addressing negative externalities, such

as pollution.225 They argue that this taxation approach surpasses command-and-control regulations,
which can be rigid and inefficient, and trading systems, which may face implementation challenges
and market failures.226 This framework not only promotes safety but also fosters innovation as
businesses seek cost-effective ways to reduce their tax burden by adopting safer, cleaner practices.227
Building on these theoretical foundations, we propose implementing corrective taxes in the AI
development context through a comprehensive penalty framework. The tax system would impose
graduated penalties on firms that develop or deploy AI systems later determined to pose significant
public safety risks or violate established ethical standards. These penalties would operate through
two primary mechanisms: direct tax surcharges and the recapture of previously granted tax benefits.
For instance, companies deploying AI systems that demonstrate significant preventable risks—such
as leading to critical infrastructure failure or misalignment that leads to large loss of life—would face
both immediate tax penalties and the potential recapture of prior R&D credits and expensing
benefits.228 This dual approach ensures that firms internalize the full social cost of unsafe
development practices while creating strong ex ante incentives for responsible innovation.229 This
measure not only holds companies accountable for prioritizing safety but also ensures that public
funds are not inadvertently subsidizing harmful AI practices. By linking tax benefits directly to past
compliance with safety regulations, policymakers can create a strong financial disincentive for
neglecting safety in AI development, reinforcing the importance of responsible innovation. Monies
collected from such tax penalties will help reverse negative spillovers of unsafe AI practice by
supporting research and development of AI safety standards.230
The tax system has demonstrated significant capability in designing and implementing effective
penalties through established administrative frameworks. 231 In the oil and gas industry, for instance,

taxes should undertake that measure). See also Shawn E. Fields, Regulatory Trading, 90 U. CHI. L. REV. 1095, 1096 (2023)

deductions for intangible drilling costs may be challenged or revoked if expenses are mischaracterized
or if companies violate environmental regulations.232 Similarly, developers receiving Low-Income
Housing Tax Credits must adhere to affordable housing requirements; failure to meet these
obligations, such as maintaining affordability or safety standards, results in credit recapture.233
Employment-related incentives, including the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, can be revoked when
employers violate labor laws or engage in discriminatory practices. 234 Renewable energy and
environmental tax credits provide another instructive example, as these benefits remain contingent
on meeting specific compliance milestones.235
Building on these established frameworks, we propose a two-pronged approach combining ex
ante investment requirements with ex post enforcement mechanisms. As a preventive measure, firms
in the AI industry must allocate a minimum portion of their development research budget (say, 25%)
toward safety-focused activities to qualify for tax benefits, including wage deductions and R&D
credits. Qualifying safety expenditures would encompass robust testing protocols, adversarial attack
mitigation, and alignment validation frameworks. On the enforcement side, firms that experience
significant safety failures—such as critical system misalignment or demonstrated harm to users—
would face both credit recapture and potential tax penalties calibrated to harm severity.
The implementation challenge lies primarily in validating safety-related expenditures,
particularly given information asymmetries between regulators and firms.236 However, the tax
system has demonstrated capacity to perform similar validations in contexts of evolving standards
and industry expertise advantages.237 The key lies in maintaining relatively permissive standards
during initial claims while reserving more stringent scrutiny for post-incident investigations or
targeted audits. This approach allows the tax system to develop relevant expertise organically while
creating strong incentives for accurate reporting and substantive safety investment.
The tax system’s experience with corporate tax avoidance offers instructive parallels for AI safety
enforcement.238 Section 357’s treatment of liability-laden property transfers demonstrates how tax

law can effectively address sophisticated avoidance strategies through a combination of clear
statutory triggers and flexible administrative standards.239 Specifically, Section 357(b)’s principal
purpose test and Section 357(c)’s quantitative thresholds create a framework that both deters abuse
and provides clear guidance for compliance.240 This model of combining bright-line rules with
standards-based oversight could be particularly valuable for AI safety regulation, where technical
complexity and rapid innovation require similar flexibility.241
The preceding analysis demonstrates how tax policy can serve as a dynamic governance
mechanism for emerging technologies. By combining ex ante investment requirements with
calibrated enforcement measures, the tax system can help bridge the critical gap between private
incentives and public safety imperatives in AI development. This approach leverages existing
administrative competencies while creating new frameworks for safety validation and compliance
monitoring.
E. The Case for Fiscal Levers
Tax policy presents distinctive advantages for promoting AI safety through its capacity to
harness existing institutional frameworks while preserving market dynamics. 242 Unlike traditional
command-and-control regulation, which can impose rigid constraints and potentially stifle
innovation, tax-based mechanisms offer organizations flexibility in achieving their objectives while
aligning private incentives with public welfare.243
The tax system's effectiveness in promoting AI safety operates through three primary
mechanisms: cultural transformation, expertise mobilization, and equitable distribution of benefits.
First, tax incentives fundamentally reshape organizational culture by making safety investments
financially advantageous. 244 When firms receive tax credits for safety-focused research, compliance

protocols, and governance frameworks, they internalize these priorities at both operational and
strategic levels. This internalization extends beyond immediate compliance, fostering industry-wide
safety consortia and creating positive network effects through initiatives like ethics training for AI
developers and dedicated safety teams.
Second, tax incentives effectively mobilize private sector expertise while preserving competitive
dynamics.245 The framework harnesses organizational expertise through multiple channels: tax
credits reward safety research investments, encourage collaboration with non-profit organizations
and academic institutions, and create natural partnerships where private companies maintain
ownership of safety initiatives while benefiting from public support. 246 This proves particularly
crucial in the global AI race, where maintaining U.S. competitiveness requires careful calibration of
safety requirements against development imperatives.
Third, the tax system’s distributive function treats AI safety as a public good, allocating costs
across taxpayers while concentrating benefits in safety-enhancing research and development. 247 This
approach proves especially valuable for fundamental safety research that may lack immediate
commercial appeal but provides critical societal benefits.248 Complementing these positive
incentives, tax penalties serve as crucial corrective mechanisms –when firms face tax consequences
for safety failures, they naturally allocate greater resources toward risk mitigation and safety
protocols.
Knowledge sharing represents another crucial advantage of tax-based safety promotion.

tax incentives can foster transparency and collaboration through rewards for adopting shared safety
standards or participating in third-party certifications.250 These public-private partnerships enable
corporations to share insights from safety research with the broader community while protecting
proprietary information.251 By rewarding participation in pre-competitive research alliances and
contributions to open-source safety tools, the framework creates positive spillover effects that
benefit the entire AI ecosystem.
The framework’s effectiveness extends beyond direct safety promotion to fostering sustainable
innovation ecosystems. Consumer-side tax credits for certified safe AI products create market
demand for responsible development practices, while organizational tax benefits encourage long-
term investments in safety infrastructure and expertise. Private corporations, leveraging their
domain expertise,252 can determine the most effective implementation of safety measures without
external micromanagement. This flexibility ensures that investments are tailored to the unique
challenges of AI safety while providing firms latitude in how they innovate and address risks.253
F. The Administrative Challenge
Although current safety tax incentives are widely used to shape behavior across various sectors,254
their application to AI safety presents distinct challenges that warrant careful consideration. Critics
raise several compelling objections that have deeply informed our framework’s development. The
most immediate concern is political economy: providing tax benefits to an already profitable
technology sector may face opposition from both policymakers and the public. 255 Any reduction in
tax revenue would need to be offset, either through increased burden on other taxpayers or reduced

public services. 256 Moreover, effective administration of these incentives poses unique oversight
challenges that strain institutional capacity. The complexity of tax mechanisms, and tax incentives
for R&D specifically, lies in their intricate design, which must balance fostering innovation and
compliance while avoiding inefficiencies, misuse, or unintended consequences, and often involves
complex audits and administrative processes to ensure proper implementation and oversight.257
Companies must identify and substantiate expenses such as wages, supplies, and contract research
related to eligible research activities, often necessitating the expertise of tax professionals.258 The need
to maintain comprehensive documentation and navigate evolving IRS guidelines adds layers of
complexity that may overshadow the credit’s potential benefits.259 Lastly, the lack of salience and
internalization of tax benefits at the upper C-suite level often results in missed opportunities to align
strategic decision-making with available incentives, as these benefits may be perceived as peripheral
or poorly integrated into broader organizational goals.260 Together, these political, distributional,
and administrative concerns demand thoughtful structuring of any proposed incentive scheme.
The political economy challenge, while significant, must be situated within the broader
landscape of existing innovation policy and institutional dynamics.261 As discussed above, firms
already access various tax incentives to support their research activities, with most of these benefits
flowing to capability development rather than safety research.262 To put the point somewhat crudely,
we are already pouring money on the industry, but perhaps too much on the wrong part of it.

Nonetheless, scholars have raised legitimate concerns about political capture,263 noting that tax
preferences are particularly susceptible to abuse by special interest groups in areas of bipartisan
agreement like innovation policy.264 Because these are reasonable concerns, our framework
incorporates several structural safeguards against such risks. First, our proposal is flexible enough to
allow policymakers redirect existing incentives toward safety research rather than creating new
benefits, addressing both budget neutrality concerns and limiting opportunities for rent-seeking
behavior. Second, the framework distributes oversight responsibility across multiple mechanisms,
including tax incentives, direct grants, regulatory exemptions, and public-private partnerships,
thereby constraining the discretion of any single agency. Third, we propose a fairly constrained
mandate for AI safety, as elaborated below. This integrated approach, combining narrow targeting
with distributed oversight, simultaneously addresses concerns about political capture while
advancing the critical goal of redirecting resources toward systematically underinvested safety
research.
A critical implementation challenge lies in precisely identifying which segments of the AI
development chain warrant targeted tax incentives. Given AI’s pervasive integration across sectors,
nearly any firm could plausibly claim qualification for safety-related benefits without meaningful
differentiation. We propose focusing initial incentive structures on foundational research and model
training activities, rather than downstream applications or product development. This upstream
prioritization finds theoretical support in two key dynamics: first, foundational research operates at
a greater remove from market pressures that might otherwise drive safety considerations; second,
advances in fundamental safety protocols at the architectural level generate positive spillover effects
throughout the development ecosystem.265 This narrower scope helps mitigate some of the political
concerns noted above.
A more fundamental challenge emerges in distinguishing genuine safety research from what we
term “safety-washing”— superficial or misleading commitments to AI safety that mask continued
prioritization of capability advancement.266 This challenge manifests along two distinct
dimensions.267 First, at the definitional level, we lack precise terminology to differentiate between
investments in general AI capabilities and specific safety measures, a distinction further complicated
by recent research suggesting positive correlations between model capabilities and certain safety

characteristics.268 Second, we face significant empirical hurdles due to the absence of well-established
safety endpoints and regulatory frameworks.269
OpenAI's 2023 safety initiatives starkly illustrate these challenges. The high-profile recruitment
of Scott Aaronson to their safety team initially generated significant optimism within the AI safety
community.270 Yet this apparent commitment proved largely ceremonial—Aaronson was tasked
primarily with developing AI writing detection tools, a narrow technical challenge focused on
academic plagiarism that never materialized into meaningful products.271 This episode exemplifies
how leading AI firms can leverage prestigious appointments and safety rhetoric while maintaining
their singular focus on capability advancement, effectively using safety initiatives as reputational
cover rather than vectors for substantive reform.
Our framework addresses these challenges by building upon the tax authorities' established
competencies rather than creating new oversight bodies. While subject-matter agencies typically
possess greater technological expertise than tax authorities, 272 and direct funding mechanisms like
grants are often considered superior to tax preferences,273 the IRS offers distinct administrative
advantages in three key areas:
First, the Internal Revenue Service has already developed sophisticated protocols for evaluating
technical research claims across various complex sectors, including biotechnology and advanced
manufacturing.[fn] Under Section 41, tax authorities regularly assess whether activities constitute
systematic investigation through experimentation to resolve technical uncertainty.[fn] This existing
framework provides a natural foundation for evaluating AI safety research through documented
protocols and clear research objectives.
Second, current R&D verification systems rely on contemporaneous documentation
requirements that can be readily adapted for AI safety research. 274 Just as firms must maintain

worry,” he asks rhetorically, “that OpenAI is just hiring me to be able to say ‘look, we have Scott Aaronson working on the
problem,’ rather than actually caring about what its safety researchers come up with?”, and responds that that while he can’t
prove that this isn’t a concern, he “was impressed by [their] detailed, open-ended engagement . . . sort of like how it might look
if they actually believed what they said.”). Scott Aaronson, OpenAI!, Shtetel Optimized (June, 17th, 2022).

contrary).” Liron Shapira, https://perma.cc/6PG8-PXSZ.

detailed records for traditional R&D credits,275 AI developers would document specific safety
activities including alignment testing protocols, robustness evaluations against adversarial attacks,
red-teaming exercises and outcomes, safety-relevant model behaviors during training, and systematic
investigation of failure modes and mitigation strategies.
Third, the evaluation framework can leverage emerging industry standards and technical
benchmarks to create concrete qualification metrics.276 These would include implementation of
specific safety protocols (such as adversarial training and bounded optimization), achievement of
quantifiable safety benchmarks (like robustness scores and alignment metrics), development of
safety monitoring systems, contributions to open-source safety tools, and systematic documentation
of model behaviors and interventions.277 By adhering to predetermined AI safety priorities
established by technical committees, the framework maintains administrative efficiency while
ensuring tax authorities are not overburdened with complex technical determinations.278
To further streamline implementation, we propose several administrative simplifications:
standardizing eligibility criteria and reliability definitions, adopting pre-certification systems for
upfront verification, automating documentation through digital platforms, and shifting toward
output-based incentives tied to measurable outcomes rather than solely input-based claims.279

Regular program reviews would ensure these incentives remain effective and manageable without
unnecessary administrative burdens.280
Overall, implementation of incentives to cutting edge research presents some inescapable
difficulties. We believe that the proposal offers a realistic path of administration that, while sensitive
to difficulties, offers a meaningful and practical path forward. If we are to encourage safety research
and implementation, we must start building towards the appropriate regulatory apparatus. Existing
tools within tax authorities offer a promising way forward that is—relatively speaking—less
demanding in terms of subject matter expertise than alternative oversight proposals.
Conclusion
This Article has argued that tax policy can serve as a powerful and underutilized tool for
promoting AI safety. We began by examining the growing capability-safety gap in AI
development—where advances in AI capabilities have rapidly outpaced our ability to ensure these
systems operate safely and reliably. At the heart of this gap lies what we termed the social
misalignment problem: while the rewards from powerful AI systems accrue privately to their
developers, the risks and potential harms are broadly socialized across society.
Drawing on extensive precedents from energy efficiency, workplace safety, and environmental
protection, we demonstrated how tax policy has historically helped resolve similar misalignment
challenges. Our framework proposes three interlocking mechanisms: producer-side incentives that
reward safety research and development, consumer-side credits that stimulate demand for certified
safe AI products, and corrective tax penalties that internalize the social costs of unsafe development
practices. Rather than creating entirely new administrative structures, this approach leverages the
tax system's existing competencies in monitoring research activities and verifying compliance.
The framework's utility extends well beyond AI safety. 281 It offers a blueprint for using fiscal
policy to address market failures in emerging technologies where private incentives diverge from
public welfare. Whether in biotechnology, nanotechnology, or other domains where innovation

carries both tremendous promise and significant risk, carefully calibrated tax incentives can help
align private sector behavior with social imperatives. 282 By making safety investments financially
advantageous while penalizing reckless development, 283 tax policy can foster cultures of responsible
innovation across multiple technological frontiers. 284
Critics may argue that tax incentives alone cannot guarantee safe AI development. We agree—
no single regulatory tool can fully address the complex challenges posed by transformative
technologies. However, tax policy offers distinct advantages over traditional command-and-control
regulation, particularly in fast-moving technical domains where regulators face significant
information and expertise asymmetries. By harnessing market mechanisms and firm-level knowledge
while preserving innovation incentives, tax policy can play a crucial role in a broader regulatory
ecosystem.
The urgency of addressing AI safety cannot be overstated. As systems grow more capable and
autonomous, the stakes of ensuring their reliable and beneficial operation continue to rise. Our
framework offers a practical path forward, one that recognizes both the tremendous promise of AI
technology and the critical importance of developing it safely and responsibly. Give me a lever and a
place to stand, Archimedes said, and I can move the world.
