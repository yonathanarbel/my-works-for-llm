- [ssrn-2820650](papers/ssrn-2820650/summary.md): Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that debtor wealth dictates asset shielding decisions. His theory posits that wealthier debtors often find shielding large asset volumes too costly and thus irrational. Conversely, poorer debtors present a higher shielding risk. This dynamic, where shielding is more rational for poorer debtors, significantly influences credit markets.

- [ssrn-2835482](papers/ssrn-2835482/summary.md): Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that commercial interests and tort reformers are using apology laws—which make apologies inadmissible in court—as a potent new tool to advance their agenda. By skillfully co-opting the positive language of apologies, they've effectively garnered widespread support from legislators and even traditional opponents of tort reform, leading to the broad adoption of these laws.

- [ssrn-1641438](papers/ssrn-1641438/summary.md): Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that specific performance in contract law is often less effective and less frequently sought than theories suggest. His qualitative study in Israel reveals parties avoid it due to enforceability issues, lawyer agency problems, and changing preferences. When pursued, motivations include signaling or post-judgment renegotiation. Findings show practical enforcement difficulties, especially for unique goods, and challenge assumptions in both rights-based and economic theories, highlighting a gap between legal doctrine and real-world litigant behavior and outcomes, necessitating a re-evaluation of its role and efficacy.
- [ssrn-3015569](papers/ssrn-3015569/summary.md): Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that the current consumer debt litigation system is failing due to prevalent unmeritorious claims and consumer inability to defend themselves. He proposes "Adminization," where an administrative agency acts as a cost-effective gatekeeper, using sampling and AI to audit lawsuits and levy large fines against those filing baseless claims. This aims to deter abuse, enhance judicial efficiency, and provide meaningful oversight, offering a more just and economically viable solution than existing court-based approaches or proposed reforms like expanded legal aid.

- [ssrn-3239995](papers/ssrn-3239995/summary.md): Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that consumer-sourced reputation systems, widely believed to replace formal regulation, suffer from inherent "Reputation Failure." Due to the public-good nature of reviews and misaligned incentives, these systems produce systematically distorted information (e.g., sluggishness, extreme reviews). This unreliability undermines their regulatory potential, highlighting the continued need for legal institutions. Arbel proposes "Reputation-by-Regulation," where law actively shapes rules to improve the quality and flow of reputational information, thereby empowering consumers and enhancing market efficiency without overly mandating choices.

- [ssrn-3272595](papers/ssrn-3272595/summary.md): Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that while Professor Croley's *Civil Justice Reconsidered* aptly describes the civil justice crisis of cost and inaccessibility, its diagnosis of under-participation by meritorious plaintiffs is not empirically proven and its reliance on win rates is misleading. Arbel contends Croley's proposed reforms, like increasing case volume, would overwhelm the system, especially concerning the neglected crisis in debt collection. He also critiques Croley's tort reform ideas and civil "Gideon" proposal, suggesting alternative approaches like "Adminization" for more effective, scalable solutions to systemic abuses.

- [ssrn-3311527](papers/ssrn-3311527/summary.md): Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that expanding defamation law is misguided. He contends that such expansions overlook crucial "audience effects," where stricter laws can paradoxically harm reputations by making any remaining false statements appear more credible. This increased believability means attempts to fight "fake news" by strengthening defamation law could backfire. Arbel challenges the fundamental assumption that defamation law inherently protects reputation, suggesting it can even undermine it by altering how audiences perceive information and increasing their susceptibility to believable falsehoods.

- [ssrn-3452662](papers/ssrn-3452662/summary.md): Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that information regulation often overlooks how audiences adjust their beliefs and actions based on the strictness of laws governing statement veracity. His research aims to address this "audience gap" by using a Bayesian game to model interactions between speakers, targets, and audiences, particularly examining how legal strictness impacts their behavior and the resulting information landscape.

- [ssrn-3501175](papers/ssrn-3501175/summary.md): Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that a small group of hyper-persistent consumers, dubbed "nudniks," play a crucial role in market discipline by actively challenging seller misconduct, benefiting all consumers. However, sellers increasingly use big data to identify and neutralize these nudniks, undermining accountability. Arbel calls for legal strategies to protect this vital "nudnik-based activism" and preserve its positive spillovers, shifting focus from mythical contract-readers to these real-world enforcers of market norms.

- [ssrn-3519630](papers/ssrn-3519630/summary.md): Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that the widespread legal practice of using all-caps in consumer contracts to ensure key terms are conspicuous and consent is improved is deeply flawed. His empirical research demonstrates that all-caps text fails to enhance consumer understanding, provides no benefits for most readers, and significantly harms the comprehension of older individuals. Arbel calls for abandoning this unsubstantiated tradition and exploring more effective disclosure methods.

- [ssrn-3568768](papers/ssrn-3568768/summary.md): Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that traditional consumer protection, thought to rely on an "informed minority" reading contracts, is ineffective. Instead, a new type of activist, the "nudnik" or "crusading minority," drives market discipline. Motivated by moral outrage and a sense of justice rather than contract details, nudniks use public shaming, complaints, and lawsuits to punish firms for perceived wrongdoings. These actions create broad benefits, making nudniks the "unsung heroes" of consumer markets, even if their individual motivations or actions can sometimes be controversial.

- [ssrn-3681083](papers/ssrn-3681083/summary.md): Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that "contract creep" represents the subtle, gradual extension of contractual terms into previously non-contractual spheres of social life, such as casual online interactions and the use of everyday products. He contends that this phenomenon, often propelled by boilerplate language and digital agreements, reconfigures social relationships and norms, frequently occurring without explicit consent or public awareness, thus fundamentally altering societal interactions.

- [ssrn-3740356](papers/ssrn-3740356/summary.md): Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that AI-powered "smart readers" represent a significant breakthrough in contract analysis, capable of simplifying, personalizing, and benchmarking terms for consumers. While offering profound benefits like increased understanding, improved market competition, and enhanced access to justice, these tools also introduce serious risks such as errors, bias, adversarial exploitation, and discrimination. Arbel calls for a new legal and regulatory framework to navigate these complex implications, as current doctrines are unprepared for this technological shift and its impact on contract law and consumer protection.

- [ssrn-4491043](papers/ssrn-4491043/summary.md): Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that Large Language Models (LLMs) as 'smart readers' can significantly simplify complex contracts, reducing length and improving readability to empower consumers against the 'no-reading problem.' While not flawless—sometimes misinterpreting legal terms or omitting information, thus not replacing lawyers—they offer a scalable solution for daily transactions. Arbel concludes these tools mark a significant improvement, potentially revolutionizing consumer contracting and necessitating a paradigm shift in law and policy, despite needing to address accuracy and bias concerns.

- [ssrn-4526219](papers/ssrn-4526219/summary.md): Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that Large Language Models (LLMs) introduce "Generative Interpretation," a paradigm shift in legal text analysis. This approach enables AI to parse contracts, identify ambiguities, and predict judicial outcomes, offering a potentially cheaper, more accurate, and accessible method than traditional textualism or contextualism. He posits that generative interpretation can resolve long-standing interpretive debates, enhance access to justice, and fundamentally re-equip legal theory for AI's role as an active interpretive agent in contract law.

- [ssrn-4631897](papers/ssrn-4631897/summary.md): Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that new technologies are enabling "nano contracts"—extremely small-scale agreements governing ephemeral, minuscule-value interactions previously outside formal law. While nano contracts can unlock new opportunities and efficiencies, they also carry significant risks, challenge effective regulation, could collapse private law boundaries, and reveal scale's neglected role in private law.

- [ssrn-4666854](papers/ssrn-4666854/summary.md): Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that AI presents comprehensive, society-wide risks, from current harms like bias to potential existential threats, primarily due to the critical AI alignment problem. He advocates for systemic, precautionary regulation targeting AI as a technology, not just its applications. This approach is necessary due to AI's unique characteristics, its potential for rapid, unexpected advancements, and the inadequacy of existing legal frameworks. Arbel explores domestic, litigation-based, and international governance strategies to manage these profound challenges and ensure AI develops safely and beneficially.

- [ssrn-4809006](papers/ssrn-4809006/summary.md): Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues for critically examining and updating legal doctrines by incorporating factors like time in contract interpretation, the profound societal and legal impacts of AI (including "AI Lies" in ssrn-4809006), and economic or behavioral insights into legal practice and individual rights. He challenges static views and advocates for dynamic, context-aware approaches to emerging legal challenges and established principles, from unbundling legal services to understanding copyright in the age of generative AI and the subtleties of price obfuscation and information disclosure.

- [ssrn-4873649](papers/ssrn-4873649/summary.md): Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that AI's potential to reduce legal costs and increase access to justice paradoxically threatens judicial economy with a litigation boom. Instead of courts historically shrinking rights to cope, he proposes proactively integrating AI tools into the legal system. This would enhance and scale judicial processes, addressing the vast unmet legal needs, leveraging AI's growing capabilities despite current flaws, and preventing regressive responses to increased caseloads. The goal is to improve justice delivery by making the system more efficient and accessible.

- [ssrn-4962098](papers/ssrn-4962098/summary.md): Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that his large-scale big data analysis empirically demonstrates modern contracts are overwhelmingly unreadable, often requiring college-level comprehension. This pervasive incomprehensibility fundamentally challenges contract law's core assumptions about informed consent and the "meeting of minds," as most individuals cannot understand the terms binding them. Arbel suggests this "readability crisis," with readability often worsening over time, necessitates a reevaluation of legal doctrines and a push for greater contractual clarity to ensure fairness and true agreement in economic and social interactions.

- [ssrn-5181207](papers/ssrn-5181207/summary.md): Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that a "capability-safety gap" in AI development, where private firms reap rewards while society bears risks, creates a social misalignment. He proposes using tax policy to address this by re-conceptualizing R&D credits to incentivize safety research, offering consumer credits for safe AI, imposing penalties for non-compliance, and redistributing penalty revenue. This approach aims to embed safety imperatives directly into the economic architecture of AI development, aligning private profit with social welfare.
