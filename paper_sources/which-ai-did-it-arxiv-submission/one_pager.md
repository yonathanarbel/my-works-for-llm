## TL;DR

AI agents can copy, split, merge, and disappear, which makes legal accountability hard because law must first identify which AI acted. The paper argues that governance needs two layers of AI identity: "thin" identity (linking AI actions to human principals) and "thick" identity (distinguishing AI agents as persistent actors with coherent goals). It proposes an "Algorithmic Corporation" (A-corp) framework to connect AI actions to human ownership while also creating stable, legally legible AI entities that can be governed directly through legal incentives.
