    <summary>This Article introduces the “generative reasonable person,” an LLM-based method for estimating how ordinary people judge reasonableness. Using Silicon Randomized Controlled Trials (S-RCTs), it replicates three published studies across negligence, consent under deception, and contract interpretation with nearly 10,000 simulated decisions. Models reproduce subtle, counterintuitive lay patterns that…</summary>

    <summary>Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that a &quot;capability-safety gap&quot; in AI development, where private firms reap rewards while society bears risks, creates a social misalignment. He proposes using tax policy to address this by re-conceptualizing R&amp;D credits to incentivize safety research, offering consumer credits for safe AI, imposing penalties for non-compli…</summary>
