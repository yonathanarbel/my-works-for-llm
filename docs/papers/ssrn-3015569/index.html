  <h2>Summary (English)</h2>
  <pre class="md">Here is the requested bullet list for &#x27;ssrn-3015569&#x27; by Professor Yonathan Arbel:

**1. TL;DR ≤100 words**

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that the current consumer debt litigation system is failing due to prevalent unmeritorious claims and consumer inability to defend themselves. He proposes &quot;Adminization,&quot; where an administrative agency acts as a cost-effective gatekeeper, using sampling and AI to audit lawsuits and levy large fines against those filing baseless claims. This aims to deter abuse, enhance judicial efficiency, and provide meaningful oversight, offering a more just and economically viable solution than existing court-based approaches or proposed reforms like expanded legal aid.

**2. Section Summaries ≤120 words each**

*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that because large companies and debt collectors file numerous unmeritorious claims against consumers who lack resources to defend themselves, leading to millions of default judgments and rendering courts ineffective, he proposes &quot;Adminization&quot;—an administrative agency acting as a cost-effective gatekeeper that samples cases and levies large fines for baseless claims to deter such wrongful behavior.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that an introductory anecdote about Margaret Donnelly, an elderly widow facing severe legal repercussions for a small, unnotified debt, illustrates a systemic problem where vulnerable individuals are caught off-guard by consumer credit legal actions, highlighting a fundamental flaw in the justice process for these cases.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a significant crisis exists with millions of consumers facing abusive debt collection lawsuits, many lacking merit or concerning already settled debts, particularly targeting those unable to afford legal representation; this is worsened by consumer difficulties in accessing courts, resulting in numerous default judgments with minimal judicial oversight.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the current system for consumer debt disputes is broken, evidenced by penalties against financial institutions for filing false affidavits and pursuing fraudulent debts; to combat this, he proposes &quot;Adminization,&quot; where a gatekeeper administrative agency would audit a sample of debt collection cases pre-litigation and issue large fines for fraud, deterring wrongful behavior.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that under his proposal, consumer protection agencies would be notified of all incoming lawsuits, using administrative powers to audit a small fraction and fine abusers. Case selection would initially be random to ensure all creditors face potential detection, similar to IRS practices, but could later be enhanced by machine learning to target statistically high-risk cases.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that &quot;Adminization&quot; proposes an administrative agency to gatekeep civil litigation, using methods like fraud detection algorithms or random selection, as a departure from traditional court-focused solutions. He criticizes current participation-based solutions within the adversarial model as unworkable, arguing they would require prohibitively costly reforms and overwhelm the already burdened court system if implemented at scale.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Adminization offers an economically and politically appealing solution to pressures on traditional legal aid, employing sampling techniques for efficient case audits to manage large volumes and deter wrongful suits, thereby offsetting operational costs. His article contributes by proposing Adminization as a normatively attractive solution for unmeritorious consumer litigation, a model for reducing abusive claims in other areas with power asymmetries, and by exploring AI for case selection.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the growing strain on judicial resources and the decline of full civil trials indicate the need for, and promise of, utilizing algorithmic decision-making within the legal process. His &quot;Adminization&quot; model highlights important, yet unexplored, complementarities between courts and agencies, challenging the traditional view that administration and civil litigation are inherently inconsistent.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his proposed &#x27;Adminization&#x27; framework is designed to overcome major legal and economic hurdles by leveraging existing regulatory agencies, which minimizes legal concerns, manages costs, and reduces regulatory capture. Adminization also aims to appeal to creditors by potentially increasing consumer confidence and market legitimacy, thereby prevailing over alternative solutions in terms of effectiveness, cost, and justice.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that consumer credit contracts, such as for credit cards or hospital bills, allow deferred payment; if consumers default, creditors typically begin with informal collection methods like dunning letters and phone calls. During this stage, creditors leverage credit reporting alongside psychological and social pressure, though many unpaid debts ultimately escalate to lawsuits, which constitute a majority of civil litigation.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that consumer credit litigation is extremely prevalent, with millions of lawsuits filed annually in the U.S. and an estimated one in three Americans facing potential lawsuits or having accounts in collections. This type of litigation is processed through an adversarial system, which operates on the &quot;sporting theory of justice&quot;—positing that truth emerges from the self-interested participation of conflicting parties before a judge.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that systematic consumer underparticipation in credit litigation invites fraud and abuse, with regulators consistently finding banks and debt buyers filing nonmeritorious lawsuits, forging affidavits, and pursuing time-barred debts. Further evidence of this pervasive abuse includes the significant number and nature of consumer complaints regarding debt collection practices, such as demanding money that is not actually owed.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that consumers file hundreds of thousands of complaints annually with regulators like the FTC and CFPB concerning the debt collection process, particularly when claims escalate to lawsuits. These complaints predominantly involve allegedly invalid debts, abusive communications, and illegal threats, aligning with expert opinions that the industry is rife with abuse and unfairly targets vulnerable demographics, including the elderly.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a striking lack of necessary evidence from plaintiffs in debt collection lawsuits is a significant indicator of abuse, with one judge estimating this occurs in ninety percent of cases and an empirical study finding no evidence at all in forty-six percent. When evidence is produced, its quality is often very poor, frequently lacking crucial details like debt breakdown or payment history, and much of it is &quot;facially invalid,&quot; consistent with concerns about practices like &quot;robo-signing.&quot;
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the frequent lack of evidence for debts, particularly when owned by parties not involved in the original transaction, strongly suggests that many collection lawsuits are nonmeritorious. He also notes strong evidence of abuse in the notification process, exemplified by &quot;sewer service,&quot; where debt collectors falsely claim to have served summonses to secure default judgments.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a substantial body of evidence, including studies and legal cases, points to a serious and persistent problem with faulty service of process, leading to an &quot;astonishing&quot; number of default judgments. This improper service often involves false affidavits or the overuse of methods like &quot;nail and mail&quot; and delivery to other household members, which are intended as last resorts rather than standard practice.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that consistent evidence from various sources, coupled with theoretical grounds of moral hazard, indicates that fraud and abuse in consumer credit litigation represent a serious problem. Simultaneously, consumers often find courts inaccessible, leading to very low rates of response to lawsuits, appearance in court, and acquisition of legal representation.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a significant number of litigants, particularly debtors, proceed pro se (1.8 million in New York in 2014 alone) against almost universally represented creditors, creating a power imbalance that often leads to unfavorable settlements where debtors relinquish legally protected assets. These participation gaps are attributed to debtors&#x27; lack of resources, sophistication, and legal knowledge, which also burdens the court system and presents access problems even in informal small claims courts.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that consumer apathy towards the legal process is often a rational response because the substantial costs of full participation, including lost wages and attorney fees, frequently exceed the potential benefits. With average consumer law attorney fees around $361 per hour, leading to total costs of $800-$1,600 for an average case, paid representation is often unviable when the case value is similar, and proceeding pro se remains challenging.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a significant lack of judicial oversight exists in consumer credit cases, as the vast majority, potentially millions annually, result in default judgments with minimal scrutiny. One factor contributing to this limited oversight is the adversarial nature of the legal process, which restricts judges’ investigative authority and exacerbates informational problems for the court.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that structural issues like consumer inexperience, rational apathy, and psychological barriers, combined with creditors&#x27; advantages as repeat players and overloaded civil courts, lead to low judicial scrutiny in consumer debt cases. This system, where private settlements often yield worse results for consumers and judges frequently rubberstamp agreements, ultimately functions as an &quot;incubator of abuse&quot; by incentivizing unmeritorious or inflated claims with minimal oversight.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that he proposes &quot;Adminization,&quot; a model of civil litigation designed for cost-effective oversight by leveraging administrative agencies that operate independently of user participation to address flaws in current consumer protection. This system would feature a gatekeeper agency using powers like sampling, audits, and fines to investigate cases and sanction plaintiffs with baseless claims, thereby protecting consumers and reducing unwanted litigation.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his concept of Adminization challenges the traditional jurisprudential view that posits a fundamental tension between the individualized justice of civil litigation and the generic, bureaucratic management by agencies. He argues this traditional emphasis overlooks much that is complementary and productively coexistent, with Adminization focusing on the optimal design of institutions that promote due process, efficiency, and justice.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Adminization, a concept designed to enhance civil litigation, involves three central features run by a central agency: audits and fines, sampling, and third-party communications. The &quot;audits and fines&quot; feature entails the agency proactively investigating claims by collecting evidence, interviewing witnesses, and assessing the claim&#x27;s validity, operating similarly to how the EEOC functions.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that government agencies like the EEOC, IRS, and CFPB possess broad investigatory powers, enabling them to acquire considerable information and handle a vast number of cases annually. He notes that despite seeming wasteful, agency-led information collection is highly attractive because agencies can direct parties to pertinent evidence and access information, such as agency records or third-party data, that may be unavailable to individuals.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that agencies can use audits to inspect cases for plausibility and signs of abuse, such as false evidence or unverified debts, and can complement these with fines against baseless claims to sanction noncompliant behavior even with defendant underparticipation. While this system of audits and fines provides a bulwark against abuse where underparticipation is an issue, the prohibitive cost of auditing all cases necessitates strategies like sampling and artificial intelligence for resource management.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that unlike civil litigation where judges must attend to all cases, administrative agencies can strategically allocate attention and resources, exemplified by the IRS&#x27;s selective in-depth reviews. Agencies utilize various sampling methods, including random sampling, which is simple but may waste resources, or criteria-based sampling, which risks being gamed or costly to prescreen.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that smart sampling, a promising approach, uses Big Data and artificial intelligence with machine learning algorithms to identify cases statistically most likely to involve fraud based on the resolution of similar past cases. This method offers speed, low cost, and potential accuracy, and its complex &quot;black box&quot; nature makes it difficult for market participants to game, with similar AI-assisted fraud detection already in use privately and being developed by agencies like the SEC.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that AI technology in the credit card industry effectively detects fraud by evaluating millions of daily transactions in real time against consumer models, flagging suspicious deviations with low error rates. He notes another telling example of AI&#x27;s success is spam filtering, where algorithms have overcome the vast richness of human communication to identify spam, a problem previously considered nearly impossible for computers to solve.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Google&#x27;s Gmail demonstrates the power of statistical algorithms by filtering ninety-nine percent of spam with very low rates of false positives, resulting in less than 0.1 percent of inbox email being spam. He also cites Benford’s law as another example, which can detect potential accounting fraud by identifying unnatural distributions in the leading digits of reported numbers, a principle software can expand upon with more sophisticated, multi-faceted rules.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that developing sophisticated rules for Adminization requires a large body of labeled training data, which is readily available from existing judicial records or &quot;systemic facts.&quot; Furthermore, the Adminization process itself would constantly produce new data through its audit system, allowing the machine learning algorithm to self-modify and continuously improve based on the results.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Adminization, where an agency handles service of process and communications, would directly solve structural problems of private service by informing defendants of their rights and providing educational materials, a task for which agencies are better suited. He suggests this concept can be applied to consumer credit litigation, with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) being a particularly appealing agency due to its scale and broad existing powers.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) could implement a debt claim process where claimants submit rudimentary information about the debt, sufficient for an unsophisticated consumer to assess, while acknowledging they hold supporting evidence. The agency would then use an automated machine learning system to screen these claims, checking for issues like time-barred debts or excessive interest, and automatically reject those with clear violations to filter out invalid &quot;zombie debts.&quot;
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his proposed system will employ &quot;smart sampling&quot; using algorithms that synthesize statistical information about creditors, debtors, and case characteristics to identify debt collection cases most likely to involve fraud or abuse. These flagged cases would then be investigated by agency auditors who can demand proof, contact consumers, and, if wrongdoing is found, levy significant fines against the plaintiff, subject to appeal.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the use of audits and fines can provide consumers with basic protection by eroding the harsh consequences of underparticipation and sanctioning fraudulent or unsupported claims. Following this, all cases should proceed to a “Communication” stage where the agency, not the plaintiff, contacts consumers with simple, clear forms that explain the claim and provide options to admit, contest, or ignore it.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his proposed system allows consumers to respond to debt claims by paying, offering settlement, or easily contesting them via checkboxes, with creditors only needing to provide full evidence if the case proceeds to litigation. The outcomes of these contested or ignored cases would then be fed into machine learning algorithms for future improvements and used to manage an internal creditor reputation score, influencing audit frequency.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Adminization complements litigation by significantly curtailing unmeritorious claims through potential fines, leading to cost savings for the judicial system and deterring frivolous lawsuits. This system also benefits creditors by increasing the reliability of consumer credit contracts and consumers by making credit a safer, more accessible option, especially for those in poverty, with costs offset by reduced litigation.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that participation-based solutions, which aim to incentivize consumer involvement to provide judges with information, generally entail immense costs for only marginal benefits when compared to administrative review. He cites &quot;lawyering up&quot; through public subsidies for legal services as a prominent example intended to increase consumer assertion of rights and inform judges, but argues for a higher return on investments in administrative screening mechanisms.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the proposal to provide a &quot;civil Gideon&quot; right, offering attorneys to indigent individuals in civil proceedings, is unworkable, prohibitively costly, and of marginal effectiveness. He argues the immense cost stems from the staggering number of potentially eligible individuals, estimated at tens of millions nationwide, many of whom face multiple legal issues, far exceeding conservative cost projections.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that by analyzing the actual costs of existing legal aid institutions, such as New York&#x27;s IOLA fund which reported a per-case cost of $897, current projections for national legal aid expenses are likely underestimated by at least an order of magnitude. He calculates that if this per-case cost were applied to the approximately thirty-two million Americans eligible for assistance, the annual cost would amount to $28.7 billion.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while restricting legal aid to consumer credit cases might lower costs, this reduction is unlikely to be substantial due to challenges in classifying complaints and the sheer volume of such litigation. He notes that means or merit testing offer more promising cost-reduction avenues, yet they introduce their own difficulties, including setting appropriate thresholds, the paradox of merit testing, administrative burdens, and potential applicant stigma.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that legal aid in this context faces extremely high costs, and attempts to reduce these costs involve difficult compromises that either diminish testing effectiveness or restrict aid, largely maintaining the status quo. He argues the benefits of such legal aid are quite limited because most cases are not genuinely disputed, potentially drowning valid defenses in noise, and creditors would likely counter-invest in legal services, further diluting any positive impact.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a common proposal to have judges actively intervene in litigation to level the playing field for consumers is problematic due to uncertainty about whether inquisitorial systems yield better results and concerns about judicial confirmation bias. This approach would also necessitate fundamental changes to legal education and training, and he highlights the troubling costs, as judges performing lawyers&#x27; duties could be more expensive than public subsidies for private lawyers.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that some propose modifying legal procedures to mitigate evidentiary problems by requiring plaintiffs, like creditors, to assert detailed knowledge and produce more evidence for their claims. He views this as a poor solution, arguing that without meaningful judicial scrutiny to verify evidence, such requirements are wasteful and unlikely to improve outcomes.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that high evidentiary bars in debt collection cases risk deterring meritorious lawsuits and result in redundant evidence production, given that most such cases are undisputed. He argues that on the margin, it would be more productive to invest in administrative audits to ensure fairness rather than categorically requiring high evidentiary standards in all debt collection cases.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that proposals to change the venue of consumer credit cases, such as shifting them to general civil or federal courts or restricting court access, are unlikely to resolve core issues and may even exacerbate problems like abuse in informal collection. He also finds procedural reforms aiming to directly regulate plaintiff behavior, like requiring affidavits or enhanced service documentation, problematic as they depend on creditors whose financial incentives often misalign with intended consumer protections.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while consumer arbitration theoretically offers benefits like overcoming complex procedures and reducing costs, it ultimately fails to solve the structural issues that &#x27;Adminization&#x27; addresses, particularly in consumer credit litigation. This failure stems from arbitration being a contractual instrument, which tends to replicate market dynamics where creditors draft agreements and influence arbitrator choice, thus structurally impeding fair outcomes for consumers.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that arbitration has largely failed to improve consumer protection, citing prohibitive costs for consumers with small claims, outcomes overwhelmingly favoring creditors, and evidence of arbitrator shopping. While the alternative of class defense, which consolidates dispersed defendants to make defending claims more cost-effective, shows greater potential, it is unlikely to fully resolve these problems due to the narrow criteria for class actions.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that even if reforms successfully encouraged a large portion of consumers to contest unfair charges and abuses in court, this would constitute a pyrrhic victory as the legal system would be unable to support such a significant increase in litigation. Any moderately successful reform bringing more consumers to court would encumber the already overwhelmed courts with potentially millions of new cases each year.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that accommodating a potential surge in consumer credit cases would require a massive, potentially unsustainable increase in the civil legal system&#x27;s capacity and national expense. Beyond these direct costs, he foresees unseen consequences, including debtors being more inclined to defend less meritorious cases and creditors finding small claims less worthwhile to pursue due to increased litigation expenses.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Adminization is intended to complement, not substitute, litigation, with both systems working in tandem to improve outcomes and reduce costs in addressing multicausal consumer protection problems. While using agencies like the FTC and CFPB for Adminization might introduce some legal issues, he believes these concerns are surmountable as these bodies already possess foundational legal authority, such as that granted to the CFPB by the Dodd-Frank Act, to oversee consumer protection.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that federal agencies like the FTC and CFPB possess significant legislative authority, including under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, to investigate, bring lawsuits, levy fines, and supervise financial entities to curb unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices in consumer debt collection. These broad powers, which explicitly cover even purely intrastate abusive debt collection, are intended to support the &quot;Adminization&quot; of consumer debt litigation and enable enforcement against a wide array of regulated entities.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the regulatory reform concept of &quot;Adminization&quot; could achieve political success by appealing to diverse interests, including those on the consumer side seeking robust protection. He suggests Adminization would also be appealing to creditors, who stand to gain from a streamlined process, greater consumer confidence, and increased legitimacy in debt collection.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Adminization offers a politically feasible approach because its mutual advantages for debtors and creditors could garner greater support than alternatives, as evidenced by a similar successful reform in Israel where creditors and consumers united. However, he acknowledges a key concern is the potential for regulatory capture, where creditor interest groups might lobby and unduly influence the administrative agency.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that concerns about regulatory capture in &quot;Adminization&quot; are unconvincing, as many agencies operate without being hopelessly captured, consumers also mobilize politically, and the proposed system merely adds a layer to court proceedings, diminishing the benefit of capture. He also notes that the challenge regarding the costs of running the agency is not critical, particularly because utilizing the existing CFPB platform would mean low set-up costs.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the cost of audits for &#x27;Adminization&#x27;, estimated using a Fermi approach at roughly $700 per case and totaling around $44.8 million, is significantly lower than leading alternatives and potentially cheaper than the current system. He adds that another source of cost, algorithm development, would largely be a one-off expenditure, suggesting that &#x27;Adminization&#x27; could be a financially viable system.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that objections to public funding for &#x27;Adminization&#x27; in private financial matters overlook the substantial existing government subsidies for the current court system, making the true issue one of optimal subsidy allocation. He argues that civil litigation, particularly in consumer credit, is plagued by systemic failures such as predatory practices and inadequate judicial oversight, which enables the &quot;success method&quot;—the strategic filing of unmeritorious claims due to lax screening.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his proposed solution of &quot;Adminization&quot; introduces a new regulatory mode using a gatekeeper agency for oversight where participation is systematically lacking, offering robust due process, cost-effectiveness, and potential broad political support. This system would grant consumers greater access to justice and creditors increased market confidence, with future applications envisioned in diverse areas like housing, employment law, and civil rights, making it a forward-looking regulatory model.</pre>

  <h2>摘要（中文）</h2>
  <pre class="md">好的，这是SSRN-3015569号文件（作者：阿拉巴马大学法学院Yonathan Arbel教授）的正式中文摘要：

**1. 内容概要（不超过100词）**

阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授认为，由于缺乏依据的索赔普遍存在以及消费者无力为自身辩护，当前的消费者债务诉讼系统正濒临失效。他提出了“行政化管理”（Adminization）机制，即由一个行政机构担任成本效益高的“守门人”，通过抽样和人工智能（AI）审计诉讼案件，并对提交无依据索赔者处以高额罚款。此举旨在遏制滥用行为，提高司法效率，并提供有效的监督，从而提供一种比现有基于法院的途径或扩大法律援助等改革提议更为公正和经济上可行的解决方案。

**2. 各章节摘要（每条不超过120词）**

*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，由于大型公司和债务催收机构针对缺乏自卫资源的消费者提起大量缺乏依据的索赔，导致数百万起缺席判决，并使法院效率低下，他为此提出了“行政化管理”（Adminization）机制——即由一个行政机构担任具有成本效益的“守门人”，对案件进行抽样审查，并对无依据索赔处以高额罚款，以威慑此类不当行为。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，一则关于玛格丽特·唐纳利（Margaret Donnelly）的引人深思的轶事——一位年迈的寡妇因一笔未被告知的小额债务而面临严重的法律后果——揭示了一个系统性问题：弱势个体在消费信贷法律诉讼中措手不及，这凸显了此类案件司法程序中的根本缺陷。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，当前存在一场严重危机，数百万消费者面临滥用性的债务催收诉讼，其中许多缺乏法律依据或涉及已清偿的债务，尤其针对那些无力负担法律代理的人；消费者在诉诸法院方面困难重重，导致大量缺席判决产生，且司法监督极少，这使得情况更加恶化。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，当前的消费者债务纠纷处理系统已经失灵，金融机构因提交虚假陈述书和追讨欺诈性债务而受到处罚即是证明；为解决此问题，他提议实行“行政化管理”（Adminization），即由一个行政机构充当“守门人”，在诉讼前对债务催收案件进行抽样审计，并对欺诈行为处以高额罚款，以威慑不当行为。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，根据他的提议，消费者保护机构将被告知所有新提起的诉讼，并运用行政权力审计一小部分案件，对滥用者处以罚款。案件筛选初期将采取随机方式，以确保所有债权人都有可能被审查，类似于美国国税局（IRS）的做法，但后期可通过机器学习加强，以针对统计学上的高风险案件。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，“行政化管理”（Adminization）提议由一个行政机构通过欺诈检测算法或随机抽样等方法来对民事诉讼进行把关，这与传统的以法院为中心的解决方案有所不同。他批评当前对抗制模式下基于参与的解决方案不切实际，认为若大规模实施，将需要成本过高的改革，并会使本已不堪重负的法院系统更加难以承受。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，“行政化管理”（Adminization）为传统法律援助面临的压力提供了一个在经济和政治上均具吸引力的解决方案，它采用抽样技术高效审计案件，以管理大量案件并阻止不当诉讼，从而抵消运营成本。其文章的贡献在于，提出“行政化管理”作为处理缺乏依据的消费者诉讼的规范上可取的方案，一个减少其他权力不对等领域滥用性索赔的模型，并探讨了人工智能在案件筛选中的应用。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，司法资源日益紧张以及正式民事审判的减少，表明在法律程序中运用算法决策的必要性和前景。他提出的“行政化管理”（Adminization）模型突显了法院与行政机构之间重要但尚未被充分探索的互补性，挑战了行政管理与民事诉讼本质上不相容的传统观点。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，他提出的“行政化管理”（Adminization）框架旨在通过利用现有监管机构来克服主要的法律和经济障碍，从而最大限度地减少法律顾虑、控制成本并减少监管俘获。该机制还旨在通过可能增强消费者信心和市场合法性来吸引债权人，从而在有效性、成本和公正性方面优于其他替代方案。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，消费信贷合同，如信用卡或医院账单合同，允许延期支付；若消费者违约，债权人通常首先采用非正式催收方式，如催款信和电话催收。在此阶段，债权人利用信用报告以及心理和社会压力进行催收，尽管许多未偿债务最终会升级为诉讼，而这类诉讼构成了民事诉讼的大部分。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，消费者信贷诉讼极为普遍，美国每年有数百万起此类诉讼，据估计三分之一的美国人面临潜在诉讼或其账户处于被催收状态。这类诉讼通过对抗制系统处理，该系统基于“司法竞技理论”运作——即认为在法官面前，通过冲突各方的自利性参与能够发现真相。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，消费者在信贷诉讼中系统性的参与不足诱发了欺诈和滥用行为，监管机构持续发现银行和债务购买方提起缺乏依据的诉讼、伪造陈述书以及追讨超过诉讼时效的债务。关于债务催收行为的消费者投诉数量之多、性质之严重，例如索要实际并不拖欠的款项，进一步证明了这种普遍存在的滥用行为。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，消费者每年向美国联邦贸易委员会（FTC）和消费者金融保护局（CFPB）等监管机构提交数十万起关于债务催收过程的投诉，尤其是在索赔升级为诉讼时。这些投诉主要涉及声称无效的债务、骚扰性通讯和非法威胁，这与专家认为该行业充斥滥用行为并针对老年人等弱势群体的观点相符。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，债务催收诉讼中原告方惊人地缺乏必要证据是滥用行为的一个重要指标，一位法官估计这种情况占案件的百分之九十，一项实证研究发现百分之四十六的案件完全没有证据。即使出示了证据，其质量也往往很差，常常缺乏债务明细或还款历史等关键细节，并且许多证据“表面无效”，这与对“机器人签章”（robo-signing）等做法的担忧相符。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，债务证据的频繁缺失，特别是当债务由未参与原始交易的当事方持有时，强烈表明许多催收诉讼缺乏依据。他还指出，有确凿证据表明送达程序中存在滥用行为，例如“虚假送达”（sewer service），即债务催收员谎称已送达传票以骗取缺席判决。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，包括研究和法律案件在内的大量证据表明，送达程序瑕疵问题严重且持续存在，导致了“惊人数量”的缺席判决。这种不正当送达通常涉及虚假陈述书，或过度使用“钉邮送达”（nail and mail，指将文件钉在门上并邮寄）和向其他家庭成员送达等方法，而这些方法本应是最后手段而非常规做法。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，来自不同来源的一致证据，加上道德风险的理论基础，表明消费信贷诉讼中的欺诈和滥用行为是一个严重问题。与此同时，消费者往往发现难以诉诸法院，导致对诉讼的回应率、出庭率和获得法律代理的比率非常低。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，大量诉讼当事人，特别是债务人，在几乎普遍由律师代理的债权人面前选择自行辩护（仅2014年纽约州就有180万人），造成了权力失衡，这往往导致不利的和解，债务人被迫放弃受法律保护的资产。这种参与差距归因于债务人缺乏资源、经验和法律知识，这也给法院系统带来了负担，并且即使在非正式的小额索赔法庭也存在诉诸司法的问题。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，消费者对法律程序的冷漠往往是一种理性反应，因为全面参与的巨大成本，包括损失的工资和律师费，常常超过潜在的收益。鉴于消费法律师的平均时薪约为361美元，导致普通案件的总成本在800至1600美元之间，当案件标的额相近时，聘请付费代理往往不可行，而自行辩护仍然充满挑战。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，在消费者信贷案件中，司法监督严重缺乏，因为绝大多数案件（每年可能达数百万起）以缺席判决告终，且审查极少。导致这种有限监督的一个因素是法律程序的对抗性，这限制了法官的调查权力，并加剧了法院的信息不对称问题。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，消费者经验不足、理性冷漠和心理障碍等结构性问题，加上债权人作为“重复博弈者”的优势以及民事法院案件积压，导致消费者债务案件的司法审查力度较低。在这种体制下，私人和解的结果往往对消费者更为不利，法官也常常草率批准协议，最终使其成为“滥用行为的温床”，因为它激励了缺乏依据或虚增的索赔，而监督却微乎其微。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，他提出了“行政化管理”（Adminization）模型，这是一种民事诉讼模型，旨在通过利用独立于用户参与运作的行政机构进行具有成本效益的监督，以解决当前消费者保护中的缺陷。该系统将设立一个“守门人”机构，运用抽样、审计和罚款等权力调查案件，并制裁提出无依据索赔的原告，从而保护消费者并减少不必要的诉讼。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，他提出的“行政化管理”（Adminization）概念挑战了传统的法理学观点，该观点认为民事诉讼的个案正义与行政机构的通用化、官僚化管理之间存在根本性张力。他认为，这种传统强调忽视了两者之间许多互补和富有成效的共存之处，“行政化管理”则侧重于促进正当程序、效率和公正的最佳制度设计。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，“行政化管理”（Adminization）这一旨在加强民事诉讼的概念，涉及由一个中央机构运作的三个核心特征：审计与罚款、抽样以及第三方沟通。“审计与罚款”特征要求该机构主动调查索赔，通过收集证据、询问证人和评估索赔有效性来进行，其运作方式类似于美国平等就业机会委员会（EEOC）的职能。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，诸如美国平等就业机会委员会（EEOC）、美国国税局（IRS）和消费者金融保护局（CFPB）等政府机构拥有广泛的调查权，使其能够获取大量信息并每年处理海量案件。他指出，尽管看似浪费，但由机构主导的信息收集极具吸引力，因为机构可以指导当事人获取相关证据，并能接触到个人可能无法获得的机构记录或第三方数据等信息。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，行政机构可以利用审计来检查案件的合理性和滥用迹象，例如虚假证据或未经核实的债务，并可以通过对无依据索赔处以罚款来补充这些审计，即使在被告参与不足的情况下也能制裁违规行为。虽然这种审计和罚款制度为解决参与不足问题提供了防止滥用的保障，但审计所有案件的成本过高，因此需要采用抽样和人工智能等策略进行资源管理。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，与民事诉讼中法官必须处理所有案件不同，行政机构可以策略性地分配注意力和资源，美国国税局（IRS）的选择性深度审查即为例证。行政机构采用各种抽样方法，包括简单但可能浪费资源的随机抽样，或基于标准的抽样，后者则有被规避或预筛选成本高昂的风险。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，智能抽样是一种前景广阔的方法，它利用大数据和人工智能的机器学习算法，根据类似既往案件的处理结果，识别出统计学上最有可能涉及欺诈的案件。该方法具有速度快、成本低和潜在准确性高的优点，其复杂的“黑箱”特性使得市场参与者难以规避；类似的人工智能辅助欺诈检测已在私营部门使用，美国证券交易委员会（SEC）等机构也正在开发。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，信用卡行业的人工智能技术通过实时评估每日数百万笔交易与消费者模型进行对比，有效检测欺诈行为，能够以低错误率标记可疑偏差。他指出，人工智能成功的另一个显著例子是垃圾邮件过滤，算法已经克服了人类交流的巨大丰富性来识别垃圾邮件——这个问题曾被认为计算机几乎不可能解决。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，谷歌的Gmail通过过滤掉99%的垃圾邮件且误报率极低，展示了统计算法的强大功能，使得收件箱中只有不到0.1%的邮件是垃圾邮件。他还引用本福特定律作为另一个例子，该定律可以通过识别报告数字首位数字的非自然分布来检测潜在的会计欺诈，软件可以在此基础上利用更复杂、多层面的规则进行扩展。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，为“行政化管理”（Adminization）开发复杂的规则需要大量已标记的训练数据，这些数据可以从现有司法记录或“系统性事实”中轻易获得。此外，“行政化管理”过程本身将通过其审计系统不断产生新数据，使机器学习算法能够根据结果自我修正并持续改进。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，“行政化管理”（Adminization）机制，即由行政机构负责送达程序和沟通，将通过告知被告其权利并提供教育材料来直接解决私人送达的结构性问题，而行政机构更适合执行此任务。他建议这一概念可以应用于消费者信贷诉讼，其中消费者金融保护局（CFPB）因其规模和现有的广泛权力而成为一个特别理想的机构。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，消费者金融保护局（CFPB）可以实施一种债务索赔处理程序，要求索赔人提交关于债务的基本信息，这些信息足以让不具备专业知识的消费者进行评估，同时承认他们持有支持性证据。然后，该机构将使用自动化的机器学习系统筛选这些索赔，检查是否存在超过诉讼时效的债务或利息过高等问题，并自动驳回那些有明显违规行为的索赔，以过滤掉无效的“僵尸债务”。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，他提议的系统将采用“智能抽样”，利用算法综合关于债权人、债务人和案件特征的统计信息，以识别最有可能涉及欺诈或滥用的债务催收案件。这些被标记的案件随后将由机构审计员进行调查，审计员可以要求提供证据、联系消费者，如果发现不当行为，则对原告处以巨额罚款，并允许其上诉。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，审计和罚款的使用可以通过削弱参与不足的严厉后果，并制裁欺诈性或无依据的索赔，为消费者提供基本保护。在此之后，所有案件应进入“沟通”阶段，由行政机构而非原告，使用简单明了的表格联系消费者，解释索赔内容并提供承认、抗辩或忽略索赔的选项。
*   阿拉巴-马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，他提议的系统允许消费者通过支付、提出和解或通过勾选选项轻松对债务索赔进行抗辩，债权人仅在案件进入诉讼程序时才需要提供完整证据。这些已抗辩或被忽略案件的结果随后将被输入机器学习算法以供未来改进，并用于管理内部债权人声誉评分，从而影响审计频率。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，“行政化管理”（Adminization）通过潜在的罚款显著遏制了缺乏依据的索赔，从而为司法系统节省了成本并阻止了滥诉，是对诉讼的补充。该系统还通过提高消费信贷合同的可靠性使债权人受益，并通过使信贷成为更安全、更易获得的选项（尤其对贫困人群而言）使消费者受益，其成本则由减少的诉讼来抵消。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，与行政审查相比，旨在激励消费者参与以向法官提供信息的参与型解决方案，通常成本巨大而收效甚微。他引用通过公共补贴法律服务来实现“律师介入”（lawyering up）作为旨在增强消费者权利主张并为法官提供信息的显著例子，但他主张对行政筛选机制的投资回报率更高。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，提供“民事吉迪恩权利”（civil Gideon right，即在民事诉讼中为贫困者提供律师的权利）的提议不切实际、成本过高且效果有限。他认为，巨大的成本源于全国范围内潜在符合条件的个人数量惊人，估计有数千万人，其中许多人面临多种法律问题，远超保守的成本预测。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，通过分析现有法律援助机构的实际成本，例如纽约州的IOLA基金（律师信托账户利息基金）报告的每案成本为897美元，目前对全国法律援助费用的预测可能至少低估了一个数量级。他计算出，如果将此每案成本应用于大约三千二百万有资格获得援助的美国人，年度成本将达到287亿美元。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，虽然将法律援助限制在消费信贷案件中可能会降低成本，但由于投诉分类的挑战以及此类诉讼的巨大数量，这种减少不太可能很显著。他指出，经济状况审查或案情实质审查是更有前景的成本削减途径，但它们也带来了各自的困难，包括设定适当的门槛、案情实质审查的悖论、行政负担以及潜在的申请人污名化。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，在此背景下，法律援助面临极高的成本，而降低这些成本的尝试涉及艰难的妥协，要么削弱审查的有效性，要么限制援助范围，从而在很大程度上维持现状。他认为，此类法律援助的益处相当有限，因为大多数案件并非真正存在争议，这可能使有效的辩护淹没在噪音中，并且债权人可能会对应地增加在法律服务上的投入，进一步削弱任何积极影响。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，一种常见的提议是让法官积极干预诉讼，以便为消费者创造公平的竞争环境，但这种做法存在问题，因为纠问式制度是否能产生更好的结果尚不确定，并且存在对司法确认偏误的担忧。这种方法还需要对法律教育和培训进行根本性改革，他还强调了令人不安的成本问题，因为法官履行律师职责可能比公共补贴私人律师更为昂贵。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，一些人提议修改法律程序以减轻证据问题，要求原告（如债权人）主张详细知情并为其索赔提供更多证据。他认为这是一个糟糕的解决方案，主张如果没有有意义的司法审查来核实证据，此类要求是浪费性的，并且不太可能改善结果。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，在债务催收案件中设置高证据门槛，有可能会阻碍有理有据的诉讼，并导致证据的重复提交，因为大多数此类案件并无争议。他认为，在边际效益上，投资于行政审计以确保公平，比在所有债务催收案件中一概要求高证据标准更具成效。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，关于改变消费信贷案件审判地的提议，例如将其转移到普通民事法院或联邦法院，或限制法院的受理范围，不太可能解决核心问题，甚至可能加剧非正式催收中的滥用等问题。他还发现，旨在直接规范原告行为的程序性改革，如要求提供宣誓书或加强送达文件，也存在问题，因为它们依赖于债权人，而债权人的经济动机往往与预期的消费者保护目标不一致。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，尽管消费者仲裁在理论上具有克服复杂程序和降低成本等益处，但它最终未能解决“行政化管理”（Adminization）所针对的结构性问题，尤其是在消费信贷诉讼中。这种失败源于仲裁是一种合同工具，它倾向于复制市场动态，即由债权人起草协议并影响仲裁员的选择，从而在结构上阻碍了消费者获得公平结果。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，仲裁在很大程度上未能改善消费者保护，他列举了小额索赔消费者面临的过高成本、结果压倒性地有利于债权人以及存在挑选仲裁员（arbitrator shopping）的证据。虽然集体抗辩（即将分散的被告联合起来使抗辩更具成本效益）这一替代方案显示出更大潜力，但由于集体诉讼的标准狭窄，它不太可能完全解决这些问题。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，即使改革成功鼓励了大部分消费者在法庭上对不公平收费和滥用行为提出异议，这也将构成一场代价惨重的胜利（皮洛士的胜利），因为法律系统将无法承受如此显著的诉讼量增长。任何略有成效的、能将更多消费者带入法庭的改革，都可能使本已不堪重负的法院每年新增数百万案件。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，要应对消费信贷案件可能出现的激增，将需要民事法律系统的能力和国家开支进行大规模、可能不可持续的增长。除了这些直接成本外，他还预见到一些未见的后果，包括债务人更倾向于为缺乏依据的案件辩护，以及由于诉讼费用增加，债权人认为小额索赔不再值得追讨。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，“行政化管理”（Adminization）旨在补充而非替代诉讼，两个系统协同工作，以改善结果并降低解决多因素消费者保护问题的成本。虽然利用美国联邦贸易委员会（FTC）和消费者金融保护局（CFPB）等机构实施“行政化管理”可能会带来一些法律问题，但他认为这些担忧是可以克服的，因为这些机构已拥有基础的法律授权，例如《多德-弗兰克法案》授予CFPB的权力，以监督消费者保护。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，诸如美国联邦贸易委员会（FTC）和消费者金融保护局（CFPB）等联邦机构拥有重要的立法授权，包括依据《公平债务催收作业法》（Fair Debt Collection Practices Act），可以调查、提起诉讼、处以罚款并监督金融实体，以遏制消费债务催收中的不公平、欺骗性或滥用性行为。这些广泛的权力明确涵盖了即使是纯粹州内的滥用性债务催收行为，旨在支持消费债务诉讼的“行政化管理”，并能够对广泛的受监管实体进行执法。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，“行政化管理”（Adminization）这一监管改革概念可以通过吸引包括寻求强有力保护的消费者方在内的不同利益方来取得政治上的成功。他认为，“行政化管理”对债权人也具有吸引力，他们将从简化的流程、更强的消费者信心以及债务催收合法性的提高中获益。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，“行政化管理”（Adminization）提供了一种政治上可行的方法，因为它对债务人和债权人的共同优势可能比替代方案获得更广泛的支持，以色列一项债权人和消费者联合推动的类似成功改革即是证明。然而，他承认一个关键担忧是潜在的监管俘获，即债权人利益集团可能会游说并不当影响行政机构。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，关于“行政化管理”（Adminization）中监管俘获的担忧缺乏说服力，因为许多机构在运作时并未被无可救药地俘获，消费者也会进行政治动员，而且提议的系统仅仅是在法院程序之上增加了一个层次，从而削弱了监管俘获的益处。他还指出，关于运营该机构成本的挑战并非关键问题，特别是因为利用现有的消费者金融保护局（CFPB）平台意味着启动成本较低。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，采用费米估算法（Fermi approach）估算的“行政化管理”（Adminization）审计成本约为每案700美元，总计约4480万美元，这远低于主要的替代方案，并可能比当前系统更便宜。他补充说，另一个成本来源——算法开发——基本上是一次性支出，这表明“行政化管理”可能是一个财务上可行的系统。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，反对在私人金融事务中为“行政化管理”（Adminization）提供公共资金的意见，忽略了当前法院系统已获得大量政府补贴这一事实，因此真正的问题在于补贴的最佳分配。他认为，民事诉讼，尤其是在消费信贷领域，充斥着系统性失灵，如掠夺性行为和司法监督不足，这使得由于筛选宽松而策略性提交无理索赔的“成功方法”（success method）得以盛行。
*   阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授写道，他提出的“行政化管理”（Adminization）解决方案引入了一种新的监管模式，即在参与系统性缺乏的领域利用“守门人”机构进行监督，该方案提供了强有力的正当程序、成本效益和潜在的广泛政治支持。该系统将使消费者更容易获得司法公正，并增强债权人的市场信心，未来有望应用于住房、劳动法和民权等多个领域，使其成为一种具有前瞻性的监管模式。</pre>
