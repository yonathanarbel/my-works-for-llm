  "abstract": "A hallmark of consumer contracts is long blocks of capitalized text. Courts and legislators believe that such “all-caps” clauses improve the quality of consumer consent and thus they will often require the capitalization of certain key terms in consumer contracts. Some of the most important terms in consumer contracts—warranty disclaimers, liability releases, arbitration clauses, and automatic subscriptions—will be enforced only because they appeared in all-caps in the contract. This Article is the first to empirically examine the effectiveness of all- caps with respect to the quality of consumer consent. Using an experimental methodology, the Article finds that all-caps is significantly harmful to older readers while failing to show any appreciable improvement over regular print for others. We collect evidence from standard form agreements used by America’s largest companies and find that, despite—and perhaps because— all-caps is ineffective, it is widely used in nearly three-quarters of consumer contracts. Based on these findings and other evidence reported here, this Article lays out the dangers and risks of continued reliance on all-caps and calls for abandoning all-caps.

  <h2>Summary (English)</h2>
  <pre class="md">Bullet list for &#x27;ssrn-3519630&#x27; by Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law:

1.  ## TL;DR ≤100 words
    Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that the widespread legal practice of using all-caps in consumer contracts to ensure key terms are conspicuous and consent is improved is deeply flawed. His empirical research demonstrates that all-caps text fails to enhance consumer understanding, provides no benefits for most readers, and significantly harms the comprehension of older individuals. Arbel calls for abandoning this unsubstantiated tradition and exploring more effective disclosure methods.

2.  ## Section Summaries ≤120 words each

    *   **The Misguided Reliance on All-Caps**
        Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that courts and legislators mistakenly believe all-caps clauses in consumer contracts enhance consent, often mandating them for enforceability. He asserts this practice is a deeply misguided instance of &quot;contract lore,&quot; an ungrounded belief among lawyers, especially problematic given consumers often don&#x27;t read fine print. Arbel argues that if all-caps doesn&#x27;t improve consent, or worsens it, courts may be wrongly enforcing harsh terms based on an illusion of understanding, depriving consumers of recourse. This legal tradition lacks empirical support for its effectiveness.

    *   **The &quot;No-Reading Problem&quot; and Conspicuousness Mandates**
        Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the &quot;no-reading problem,&quot; where consumers&#x27; ignorance of fine print allows firms to include oppressive terms, undermines contractual consent. A common solution adopted by courts and legislators, such as the UCC&#x27;s requirement for conspicuous warranty waivers, is to mandate the prominent display of important terms. This strategy aims to improve consumer consent by signaling the importance of key provisions and making them more accessible, with all-caps being a widely endorsed method to achieve such conspicuousness and thereby enhance enforceability.

    *   **Prevalence and Unquestioned Tradition of All-Caps**
        Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the legal convention of using all-caps to denote consent lacks empirical support; early psychological studies indicating it impeded reading were overlooked. His new research analyzing 500 popular consumer contracts from highly visited websites like Google and Amazon reveals its pervasiveness, with over 77% containing at least one fully capitalized paragraph and 9% of all words capitalized. This prevalence in contracts affecting most American adults is troubling, as the policy is based on speculation rather than evidence of its actual effectiveness.

    *   **Experimental Findings: All-Caps Fails to Improve Consent and Harms Older Readers**
        Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his lab experiments with approximately 570 participants tested whether all-caps improves consumer consent, specifically their ability to recall contract terms. The findings show all-caps fails to improve recall and provides no appreciable benefit. Crucially, the evidence demonstrates all-caps is significantly harmful to older readers (over 55), nearly doubling their error rate, and likely fails to improve consent for others. This detrimental effect on older readers may be due to impeded readability, as all-caps homogenizes letter shapes. The &quot;fire siren&quot; theory, suggesting all-caps signals onerous terms, was also rejected.

    *   **Experimental Findings: All-Caps Under Time Pressure and Subjective Difficulty**
        Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that further experiments explored all-caps under time pressure and its subjective perception. When reading contracts under strict time limits, subjects reading all-caps showed no improvement in recall, while those reading lower-case text performed better as pressure increased. This weighs against the theory that capitalization increases text salience. Moreover, self-reported data from another study indicated respondents found all-caps contracts significantly harder to read (by 22%) and also rated them harder to understand (by 13%), challenging the notion that capitalization improves accessibility or comprehension.

    *   **Exploring Alternatives: The Promise of Bold Text**
        Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while his findings primarily undermine all-caps, he also explored alternative interventions. An exploratory study compared low-caps, all-caps, boxed text, and boldface for a liability disclaimer. The bold text treatment performed considerably better, significantly reducing respondent error rates (e.g., 27% error vs. 48-57% for others on one question). This suggests consumers readily react to targeted communicative interventions and their recall can be enhanced by design choices beyond simple capitalization. Figure 6 illustrates design choices (content vs. form, integrated vs. segregated) critical for effective disclosure.

    *   **Broader Implications: Disclosure Debates and the Failure of All-Caps**
        Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the debate on mandatory disclosures is ongoing, with some scholars advocating for them while others, like Ben-Shahar and Schneider, are disillusioned, calling disclosure potentially the &quot;least successful regulatory technique.&quot; Despite this debate, courts and legislators use a &quot;conspicuousness policy&quot; to make key terms salient. Arbel&#x27;s findings on the failure of all-caps—increased reading time, decreased subjective understanding, and no recall improvement (or decline for older readers)—support skepticism about meaningful consent to fine print and highlight all-caps as a failed &#x27;smart disclosure&#x27; method within this broader context.

    *   **The Case Against All-Caps: Legal and Practical Consequences**
        Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that courts often enforce otherwise unenforceable terms like liability waivers solely because they are in all-caps, linking capitalization with consent, while legislators often mandate this format. His analysis of 500 firms&#x27; contracts shows over 77% use all-caps, suggesting firms exploit this permissive policy rather than improve understanding. Experimental findings demonstrate individuals rate all-caps as harder to read, with no advantage even under time pressure. The evidence against all-caps being genuinely conspicuous is compelling, leading to a &quot;safe haven&quot; for firms that binds consumers to terms they struggle to read.

    *   **Conclusion and Call to Action: Abandoning All-Caps and Innovating Disclosure**
        Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the belief in all-caps&#x27; power to improve consent is a superstition, lacking empirical support and harming older readers. Courts should abandon reliance on all-caps as a proxy for consent, as it has stifled innovation in disclosure. He suggests a performance-based approach, where firms must substantiate that terms were made conspicuous, channeling their expertise towards genuinely comprehensible disclosures. Future improvements depend on such standards and considering heterogeneous effects, as current practices like all-caps disproportionately harm vulnerable groups. The success of alternatives like bold text offers optimism for designing better disclosures.</pre>

  <h2>摘要（中文）</h2>
  <pre class="md">好的，这是对Yonathan Arbel教授论文摘要的正式中文翻译：

**ssrn-3519630号论文（作者：阿拉巴马大学法学院Yonathan Arbel教授）要点清单：**

1.  ## 内容摘要（100字以内）
    阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授指出，法律实践中广泛采用在消费者合同中使用全大写字母以确保关键条款醒目并提升同意程度的做法存在严重缺陷。其 количественные исследования表明，全大写文本未能增进消费者理解，对多数读者无益，且严重损害老年群体的理解能力。Arbel教授呼吁摒弃此种未经证实的传统，探索更为有效的披露方法。

2.  ## 各章节摘要（每条120字以内）

    *   **对全大写的错误依赖**
        阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授在其研究中指出，法院及立法者错误地认为消费者合同中的全大写条款能增强同意程度，并常将其作为条款可执行性的强制要求。他断言，此做法是一种严重误导的“合同迷思”——律师间一种无事实根据的信念，尤其考虑到消费者常不阅读小号字体条款，此问题更为突出。Arbel教授认为，若全大写未能改善甚至恶化了同意的质量，法院可能正基于一种虚假的理解，错误地执行严苛条款，从而剥夺了消费者的救济途径。这一法律传统缺乏对其有效性的实证支持。

    *   **“不阅读问题”与强制醒目要求**
        阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授在其研究中指出，“不阅读问题”——即消费者对小号字体条款的无知使得公司得以加入压迫性条款——损害了合同同意的有效性。法院和立法者采纳的一种常见解决方案，如《统一商法典》（UCC）对保证弃权声明需显著标示的要求，便是强制性地突出重要条款。此策略旨在通过标示关键条款的重要性并使其更易获取，来改善消费者的同意程度，而全大写字母则被广泛认可为实现此种醒目性并进而增强条款可执行性的一种方法。

    *   **全大写的普遍性与未经审视的传统**
        阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授在其研究中指出，法律界使用全大写字母以示同意的惯例缺乏实证支持；早期心理学研究指出全大写会妨碍阅读，但这些研究被忽视了。他对谷歌、亚马逊等高访问量网站的500份热门消费者合同进行分析的新研究揭示了全大写的普遍性：超过77%的合同至少包含一个全大写段落，所有单词中9%为大写。鉴于这些合同影响大多数美国成年人，而此项政策基于推测而非其实际有效性的证据，其普遍存在令人担忧。

    *   **实验发现：全大写未能改善同意程度且损害老年读者**
        阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授在其研究中指出，他与约570名参与者进行的实验室实验测试了全大写是否能改善消费者的同意程度，特别是他们回忆合同条款的能力。研究结果显示，全大写未能提高回忆率，也未带来任何明显益处。至关重要的是，证据表明全大写对老年读者（55岁以上）有显著危害，使其错误率几乎翻倍，并且可能也未能改善其他人群的同意程度。对老年读者的这种不利影响可能是由于全大写使字母形状同质化，从而妨碍了可读性。“火警警报”理论（即全大写能警示繁重条款）也遭到了否定。

    *   **实验发现：时间压力下的全大写及主观难度感知**
        阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授在其研究中指出，进一步的实验探究了时间压力下全大写的表现及其主观感知。在严格时限下阅读合同时，阅读全大写文本的受试者在回忆方面未表现出任何改善，而阅读小写文本的受试者在压力增加时表现更佳。这与大写增加文本显著性的理论相悖。此外，另一项研究的自我报告数据显示，受访者认为全大写合同的阅读难度显著增加（22%），并且也认为其理解难度增加（13%），这挑战了全大写能提高可读性或理解度的观点。

    *   **探索替代方案：粗体文本的前景**
        阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授在其研究中指出，尽管其研究结果主要针对全大写的弊端，但他也探索了替代性干预措施。一项探索性研究比较了小写、全大写、加框文本以及粗体文本在责任免除声明中的效果。粗体文本处理表现显著更优，大幅降低了受访者的错误率（例如，在一个问题上，粗体文本错误率为27%，而其他方式为48-57%）。这表明消费者能对有针对性的沟通干预做出积极反应，并且其回忆能力可以通过超越简单大写的设计选择得到增强。图6阐释了对有效披露至关重要的设计选择（内容与形式，整合与分离）。

    *   **更广泛的启示：披露争议与全大写的失败**
        阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授在其研究中指出，关于强制性披露的争论仍在继续，一些学者倡导强制披露，而另一些学者如Ben-Shahar和Schneider则对此感到失望，称披露可能是“最不成功的监管技术”。尽管存在争议，法院和立法者仍采用“醒目性政策”以使关键条款突出。Arbel教授关于全大写失败的研究发现——阅读时间增加、主观理解度下降、回忆率无改善（老年读者甚至下降）——支持了对小号字体条款达成有意义同意的怀疑态度，并突显了在此更广泛背景下，全大写作为一种失败的“智能披露”方法。

    *   **反对全大写的论据：法律与实践后果**
        阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授在其研究中指出，法院常常仅因责任免除等条款采用全大写形式便执行这些本不可执行的条款，将大写与同意联系起来，而立法者也常强制规定此格式。他对500家公司合同的分析显示，超过77%的公司使用全大写，这表明公司在利用这一宽松政策，而非致力于改善理解。实验结果表明，个人认为全大写更难阅读，即使在时间压力下也无优势。反对全大写具有真正醒目性的证据是强有力的，这导致为公司提供了一个“避风港”，使消费者受困于他们难以阅读的条款。

    *   **结论与行动呼吁：摒弃全大写并创新披露方式**
        阿拉巴马大学法学院的Yonathan Arbel教授在其研究中指出，认为全大写能提升同意程度的信念是一种迷信，缺乏实证支持且损害老年读者。法院应摒弃将全大写作为同意的代表的做法，因为它扼杀了披露方式的创新。他建议采用一种基于绩效的方法，即公司必须证实条款已做到醒目，从而引导其专业能力转向设计真正易于理解的披露。未来的改进取决于此类标准以及对异质性效应的考量，因为当前如全大写等做法对弱势群体造成了不成比例的损害。粗体文本等替代方案的成功为设计更好的披露方式带来了乐观前景。</pre>
