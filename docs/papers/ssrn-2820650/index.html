  "abstract": "The primary means of enforcement of legal liabilities is through the seizure of debtors’ assets. However, debtors can shield their assets in various ways and thereby reduce the power of en- forcement. This paper studies the circumstances under which a debtor would choose to shield as- sets and the value of assets that would be shielded. A key idea is that borrower’s wealth mutes shielding incentives. Intuitively, avoiding debts through shielding requires that enough assets will be shielded, for else the debts can be collected from exposed assets. A wealthier debtor would thus need to shield more assets, and at a greater cost, than a debtor with limited wealth. Using this basic understanding, I develop a theory of asset shielding and explore its implications for incomplete lending contracts, explaining the role of eq- uity agreements, equity cushions and collateral, and debt forgiveness, and explore the some of the policy implications. 1 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2820650 1. INTRODUCTION The primary means of enforcement of civil legal liabilities, such as debt contracts, taxes, or tort judgments, is through the seizure of debtors’ assets.

  <h2>Summary (English)</h2>
  <pre class="md">Okay, here&#x27;s the bullet list based on the provided text:

*   **Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a debtor&#x27;s wealth significantly influences their decision to shield assets, as wealthier individuals would need to shield a larger volume of assets at greater cost for it to be effective against creditors. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his paper develops a theory of asset shielding to explain this behavior, arguing that richer debtors often find it irrational to shield, while poorer debtors pose a higher shielding risk which impacts credit markets.**

1.  ## TL;DR ≤100 words
    Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that debtor wealth dictates asset shielding decisions. His theory posits that wealthier debtors often find shielding large asset volumes too costly and thus irrational. Conversely, poorer debtors present a higher shielding risk. This dynamic, where shielding is more rational for poorer debtors, significantly influences credit markets.

2.  ## Section Summaries ≤120 words each
    Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a debtor&#x27;s wealth is a key determinant in their choice to shield assets from creditors. He notes that for wealthier individuals, the sheer volume of assets requiring protection, and the associated costs, can make shielding an ineffective or irrational strategy. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his paper introduces a theory of asset shielding to elucidate these behaviors. This theory suggests that while richer debtors may forego shielding, poorer debtors are more likely to engage in it, thereby creating a higher shielding risk that has repercussions for credit markets.</pre>

  <h2>摘要（中文）</h2>
  <pre class="md">好的，这是基于您提供的英文文本翻译的正式中文摘要：

*   **阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯（Yonathan Arbel）教授写道，债务人的财富状况显著影响其隐匿资产的决策，因为较富裕的个人若要有效对抗债权人，需以更高成本隐匿更大规模的资产。阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授在其论文中提出了一种资产隐匿理论来解释此行为，他认为，富裕债务人通常认为隐匿资产不尽合理，而贫困债务人则构成更高的资产隐匿风险，进而对信贷市场产生影响。**

1.  ## 内容摘要（不超过100字）
    阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授认为，债务人财富状况决定其资产隐匿决策。其理论阐明，富裕债务人常因隐匿大量资产成本过高而认为此举不理性；相反，贫困债务人则构成更高的资产隐匿风险。这种贫困债务人更倾向于选择资产隐匿的动态，对信贷市场具有显著影响。

2.  ## 各节摘要（每节不超过120字）
    阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授指出，债务人的财富是其决定是否向债权人隐匿资产的关键因素。他提到，对较富裕的个人而言，需要保护的资产规模庞大及相关高昂成本，可能使资产隐匿成为一种无效或不理性的策略。阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授在其论文中引入了一种资产隐匿理论以阐释这些行为模式。该理论认为，富裕债务人可能放弃隐匿资产，而贫困债务人则更倾向于这样做，由此带来更高的资产隐匿风险，并对信贷市场产生深远影响。</pre>
