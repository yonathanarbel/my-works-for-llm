<section>
  <h2>Summary (English)</h2>
  <pre class="md">Here is the requested bullet list:

1.  ## TL;DR ≤100 words
    Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that expanding defamation law is misguided. He contends that such expansions overlook crucial &quot;audience effects,&quot; where stricter laws can paradoxically harm reputations by making any remaining false statements appear more credible. This increased believability means attempts to fight &quot;fake news&quot; by strengthening defamation law could backfire. Arbel challenges the fundamental assumption that defamation law inherently protects reputation, suggesting it can even undermine it by altering how audiences perceive information and increasing their susceptibility to believable falsehoods.

2.  ## Section Summaries ≤120 words each

    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his co-authored article, &quot;The Case Against Expanding Defamation Law,&quot; examines the objectives and workings of defamation law, its relationship with reputation, and, critically, how &quot;audience effects&quot;—the way audiences perceive statements—shape the law&#x27;s effectiveness and its appropriate boundaries.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the widely held belief that defamation law safeguards reputation is flawed because it ignores &quot;audience effects&quot;—how the law shapes audience perception. He argues that stricter defamation laws can paradoxically damage reputations by making statements seem more reliable, implying that expanding these laws to combat fake news could prove counterproductive.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that concurrent political pressures to bolster libel laws, exemplified by figures like then-President Trump, and a new American Law Institute project on defamation, signal potentially imminent, significant changes to the law. He notes these calls for expansion, involving reduced safeguards and higher damages, are largely based on the prevailing theory that defamation law&#x27;s primary function is reputation protection.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the prevalent &quot;reputation-protection theory&quot; suggests stricter defamation laws, by penalizing falsehoods, protect reputations from damaging comments. His article, however, critiques this theory, highlighting its failure to account for significant &quot;audience effects&quot; – how the audience&#x27;s perception of statements is influenced by the legal framework itself.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that traditional defamation law is deficient as it neglects the &quot;audience effect,&quot; meaning harm isn&#x27;t direct but mediated by third-party perception of negative statements. Applying signaling theory, he explains that stricter defamation laws can enhance the perceived reliability of statements, because the higher cost of falsehoods (due to increased legal risk) makes these &quot;signals&quot; appear more credible than &quot;cheap talk.&quot;
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that stringent defamation law can paradoxically harm reputations because audiences, perceiving a tougher legal environment, are more inclined to believe any false statements that still surface, deeming them more reliable. His proposed trilateral framework (speaker, victim, audience) uncovers a &quot;seesaw dynamic&quot;: stricter laws reduce false statements but concurrently boost the credibility and potential harm of those that remain.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that expanding defamation law can paradoxically render audiences more credulous and vulnerable to remaining falsehoods, as they might assume a more regulated, truthful information environment. Consequently, he advises policymakers to balance the harm prevented by fewer lies against the harm from lies becoming more believable, advocating for a default to free speech if a net benefit from expansion isn&#x27;t clear.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his analysis indicates defamation law is not as protective of reputation as commonly believed, requiring a re-assessment of First Amendment considerations to favor free speech more strongly. He further warns that expanding libel laws to fight &quot;fake news&quot; could paradoxically worsen harm by creating a false public confidence in the truthfulness of published material due to perceived stricter regulation.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that defamation law is broadly recognized by courts and scholars as existing mainly to protect reputation, even within a legal framework prioritizing free speech. This fundamental belief in its protective capacity has molded legal doctrine, often causing courts to marginalize the audience&#x27;s role in how reputational harm occurs.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that rights-based theories see reputation as an aspect of property, dignity, or honor, while social perspectives view defamation law as a civilized substitute for duels. In contrast, economic theories focus on the public, defining reputation as collective opinions that help predict behavior and assess potential partners in interactions.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that reputation acts as a predictive signal of future conduct based on past behavior, reducing search costs in interactions. He notes defamation law is believed to protect reputation mainly by deterring false claims, offering redress to victims, and allowing vindication through legal proceedings that publicly ascertain truth.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that defamation law is intentionally structured not to deter every falsehood or compensate every victim, owing to court limitations and First Amendment priorities for free speech. Consequently, courts provide &quot;breathing space&quot; for speech, tolerate some misuse, and show this through reluctance to grant injunctions and by imposing higher proof standards in defamation cases.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that modern defamation law inherently struggles with balancing individual reputation protection against First Amendment free expression rights, a tension famously addressed in *New York Times Co. v. Sullivan*. He notes defamation&#x27;s ancient origins, evolving from moral teachings in early texts like Sumerian tablets and the Bible to formal legal penalties, such as in the Frankish Lex Salica.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that defamation law developed historically from ancient penalties and English common law, where spoken slander and written libel initially had distinct rules before merging into the modern tort, though some distinctions remain. Current doctrine requires a public, false statement likely to harm reputation, with &quot;public&quot; meaning communication to a third party, differentiating it from mere emotional distress.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that defamation traditionally necessitated a false statement published to a third party, with falsity initially presumed and truth serving as a defense. The pivotal *New York Times v. Sullivan* ruling &quot;constitutionalized&quot; defamation law, mandating public officials prove &quot;actual malice&quot; and establishing truth as a general absolute defense against liability.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that defamatory speech, a key element in lawsuits, damages reputation by causing negative opinion updates and reduced association with the subject. However, courts treat reputation normatively, assessing if a statement &quot;would tend&quot; to cause harm in the view of a hypothetical &quot;respectable&quot; community, rather than focusing on actual occurred harm.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that courts might find a statement non-libelous if its absurdity makes it unbelievable to rational people, underscoring the difficulty of protecting reputation via stricter defamation laws. He notes concerns about inadequate protection are tempered by existing broad unregulated areas for defamatory speech, such as opinions, statements about public officials, and third-party online content.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that defamation law&#x27;s frequent ineffectiveness, challenged by issues like anonymous speech, leads some to argue its removal would minimally worsen victims&#x27; situations. Conversely, he notes a strong consensus supports protecting opinion expression, even with falsehoods, due to liberty, social benefits, and the belief that audiences can discern some inaccuracies.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the traditional defamation model, where a speaker&#x27;s false statement directly causes harm, problematically overlooks the audience&#x27;s ability to assess truth. He emphasizes that defamation harm is mediated by the audience—speech must be believed to be damaging—and audiences should be seen as rational evaluators, not passive recipients of falsehoods.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that despite public skepticism towards unverified claims and efforts to find truth, both courts and historical figures recognize people&#x27;s susceptibility to deception. He intends to investigate the consequences of the audience&#x27;s active role in reputational harm, suggesting a trilateral model (speaker, victim, audience) for defamation law.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that for reputation to matter, unobservable quality variations must exist, illustrated by a scenario where patrons tolerate a 20% risk of a low-quality restaurant. In his model, patrons encounter ex-employees with knowledge of true quality who can give reviews; these factual assertions about quality could be legally actionable.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that defamation law is necessary because people sometimes lie. He introduces a model where ex-employees have different motivations (&quot;v&quot;) for denouncing employers, categorizing them as &quot;honest&quot; (no value from besmirching) or &quot;dishonest&quot; (low or high value from it), to analyze defamation&#x27;s effects.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes about a hypothetical &quot;D0&quot; world with very weak defamation law, where victims cannot seek legal redress for false statements due to high costs, minimal damages, or stringent proof requirements. In this scenario, a falsely maligned restaurant owner would have no recourse to sue.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that honest ex-employees report truthfully on restaurant quality, but in a lax legal environment, dishonest ones will always give negative reviews to harm former employers, irrespective of true quality. Given a hypothetical employee distribution, dishonest employees substantially inflate negative reviews, many falsely maligning good establishments.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that in a hypothetical scenario, patrons can trust positive restaurant reviews since disgruntled employees rarely offer false praise. However, upon seeing a negative review, a patron, aware of frequent falsehoods without strong defamation law, might calculate only a 38% chance of accuracy, potentially still within their acceptable risk level.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that with lax defamation laws (D0), consumers might still patronize negatively reviewed restaurants because reviews lack credibility. He then contrasts this with a &quot;D1&quot; world featuring strict defamation laws, where owners are presumed to sue over false negative reviews, though honest employees&#x27; behavior remains unchanged.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that defamation law, though not a perfect deterrent, can discourage some dishonest employees from falsely maligning high-quality restaurants, prompting truthful positive reviews due to lawsuit fears. However, highly motivated dishonest individuals, like very disgruntled employees, will likely continue defaming quality establishments despite legal risks.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that patrons, aware that some negative reviews might be false even with defamation law, may still view them as more significant signals of genuinely low quality. If the perceived probability of a negatively reviewed restaurant being bad (e.g., 55%) surpasses a patron&#x27;s risk threshold (e.g., 40%), they will likely avoid it.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that expanding defamation law can paradoxically hurt high-quality providers because fewer false negative reviews lend more credibility to the remaining ones, causing patrons to avoid good businesses that are falsely disparaged. Conversely, weak defamation law leads to many false negatives, reducing overall review reliability, so patrons often disregard them and frequent high-quality establishments.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that stricter defamation laws, by reducing false statements, can paradoxically boost public trust in statements overall, making people more vulnerable to the heightened harm of any remaining falsehoods. This &quot;seesaw dynamic&quot; implies that fewer but more credible lies can lead to audiences being more easily deceived and acting upon false information due to increased general trust.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that stricter defamation law doesn&#x27;t invariably protect reputation and can sometimes be detrimental, questioning the assumption of its unambiguous safeguarding role. His analysis concentrates on behavioral impacts on reputation, not overall social welfare, a broader issue involving multiple stakeholders and ex ante considerations.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that stricter defamation law may offer an unrecognized advantage by enhancing statement reliability, despite current worries about excessive trust in falsehoods. He suggests that significant audience effects can arise even if the public is unaware or mistaken about defamation law specifics, based merely on a general (possibly incorrect) belief that the law has been altered.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that defamation law reforms affect speaker behavior and also induce behavioral changes in the listening public, an aspect needing analysis. While audiences can be irrationally trusting, making falsehoods &quot;sticky&quot; via cognitive biases like anchoring, he believes it&#x27;s improbable that falsehoods are so compelling as to negate audience perception and rationality entirely.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the &quot;stickiness&quot; of falsehoods—their resistance to refutation—dictates whether policy should prioritize reducing lie quantity or their credibility. He notes that flawed and expensive enforcement and litigation processes for falsehoods mean incentives to lie endure, as victims encounter substantial obstacles to obtaining redress.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that enhancing defamation lawsuit enforceability would reduce lie quantity but, due to audience effects and the &quot;seesaw principle,&quot; paradoxically result in fewer yet more damaging falsehoods. He adds that social/moral norms against lying boost honest speaker numbers, elevating baseline statement credibility, and defamation law changes affect reliability relative to this baseline.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while defamation law deters some falsehoods, it can paradoxically boost the credibility of those undeterred, potentially harming reputation. He also notes that a secondary aim of defamation law is victim redress, observing that current law frequently results in their under-compensation.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that justifying defamation law as redress for reputational harm is flawed because it overlooks how the law influences audience perception, thus contributing to the harm. He cites Elon Musk using Vernon Unsworth&#x27;s lack of a lawsuit as supposed proof of guilt, illustrating how defamation law can be weaponized to harm, not protect, reputation.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that financial redress in defamation can worsen the harm it aims to fix, and its benefits must be evaluated considering audience effects. He also argues that vindicating reputation by disproving an allegation is flawed due to &quot;circularity&quot;—defamation law itself can create the need for vindication by making audiences believe initial falsehoods.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the &quot;vindication&quot; rationale for defamation law is undermined by &quot;entrenchment&quot; (a court loss solidifying falsehoods) and &quot;antivindication&quot; (failure to sue implying guilt). These issues, plus &quot;circularity,&quot; challenge the unambiguous justification of defamation law for reputation protection via vindication, requiring domain-specific analysis for such claims.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that defamation law is stricter in employment, where statements harming one&#x27;s profession are actionable per se, offering exceptional protection. This heightened safeguard is vital because false claims from ex-employers can be ruinous, as risk-averse prospective employers might deny jobs even if an allegation has a low chance of being true.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that stricter defamation law, including per se protection for claims of crime or &quot;loathsome disease,&quot; might be warranted to reduce false allegations where even a slight chance of truth is very harmful. He argues the case for such law is weaker in consumer markets, where &quot;j-shaped&quot; review distributions often see false negatives outnumbered by positives, and verifying claims from interactions poses judicial accuracy challenges.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that there should be a presumption against, or at least against broadening, defamation liability for consumer reviews, as high litigation costs could deter their creation as a public good. For political speech, despite &quot;fake news&quot; concerns, he argues defamation law should generally defer to free speech, partly because public awareness of such issues lessens some harm.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that typical constitutional analysis of defamation (free speech vs. reputation) is incomplete because stronger law might paradoxically harm reputation by fostering fewer, more credible lies versus more, less credible ones. He urges courts to weigh if fewer falsehoods justify the cost of remaining ones becoming more harmful and believable before expanding defamation law.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that judges tend to overestimate defamation law&#x27;s benefits by looking at its gross impact on reputation, not its smaller net effect considering the &quot;seesaw principle,&quot; potentially altering close case outcomes. Given constitutional free speech protection, he argues courts should favor it when uncertain about expanding defamation law, as the idea it inherently protects reputation is flawed and can be counterproductive.

## TL;DR

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that expanding defamation law is misguided. He contends that such expansions overlook crucial &quot;audience effects,&quot; where stricter laws can paradoxically harm reputations by making any remaining false statements appear more credible. This increased believability means attempts to fight &quot;fake news&quot; by strengthening defamation law could backfire. Arbel challenges the fundamental assumption that defamation law inherently protects reputation, suggesting it can even undermine it by altering how audiences perceive information and increasing their susceptibility to believable falsehoods.

  <h2>摘要（中文）</h2>
  <pre class="md">好的，这是您请求的法律摘要的正式中文翻译：

---

以下为所要求的项目列表：

1.  ## 内容摘要（≤100字）
    阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯（Yonathan Arbel）教授认为，扩大诽谤法的适用范围是错误的。他主张，此类扩张忽视了关键的“受众效应”，即更严格的法律反而可能使任何残余的虚假陈述显得更可信，从而损害名誉。这种可信度的增加意味着，试图通过加强诽谤法来打击“虚假新闻”的努力可能会适得其反。阿尔伯挑战了诽谤法固有保护名誉的基本假设，指出它甚至可能通过改变受众感知信息的方式、增加其对可信虚假信息的易感性，从而损害名誉。

2.  ## 各节摘要（每节≤120字）

    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，其合著的文章《反对扩大诽谤法适用范围的论证》探讨了诽谤法的目标与运作机制、其与名誉的关系，以及关键的“受众效应”——即受众感知陈述的方式——如何影响该法律的效力及其适用界限。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，认为诽谤法保护名誉的普遍观点存在缺陷，因为它忽视了“受众效应”——即法律如何塑造受众的认知。他认为，更严格的诽谤法反而可能因使陈述显得更可靠而损害名誉，这意味着扩大此类法律以打击虚假新闻可能适得其反。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，当前加强诽谤法的政治压力（如此时任总统特朗普等人物的倡导）以及美国法律协会新设立的诽谤法项目，均预示着该法律可能即将发生重大变革。他注意到，这些扩大适用范围的呼吁，涉及降低保障标准和提高损害赔偿，主要基于诽谤法首要功能是保护名誉的通行理论。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，盛行的“名誉保护理论”认为，更严格的诽谤法通过惩罚虚假陈述来保护名誉免受负面评论的损害。然而，他的文章批判了这一理论，强调其未能考虑到显著的“受众效应”——即受众对陈述的认知如何受到法律框架本身的影响。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，传统诽谤法存在缺陷，因其忽视了“受众效应”，即损害并非直接造成，而是通过第三方对负面陈述的认知介导。他运用信号理论解释称，更严格的诽谤法能增强陈述的感知可靠性，因为虚假陈述的成本更高（由于法律风险增加），使得这些“信号”比“廉价空谈”显得更可信。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，严苛的诽谤法反而可能损害名誉，因为受众感知到更严厉的法律环境后，更倾向于相信任何仍浮出水面的虚假陈述，认为其更可靠。他提出的三方框架（言者、受害者、受众）揭示了一种“跷跷板效应”：更严格的法律减少了虚假陈述，但同时提高了残余虚假陈述的可信度及其潜在危害。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，扩大诽谤法的适用范围反而可能使受众更容易轻信并受到残余虚假信息的影响，因为他们可能假定信息环境受到更严格的监管且更为真实。因此，他建议政策制定者权衡减少谎言所防止的损害与谎言变得更可信所造成的损害，并主张若扩大适用范围的净效益不明确，则应默认保障言论自由。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，其分析表明诽谤法对名誉的保护作用不如通常认为的那样有效，这要求重新评估《第一修正案》的考量，以更有力地倾向于言论自由。他还警告说，扩大诽谤法以打击“虚假新闻”反而可能因公众对已发布材料真实性的虚假信心（源于感知到的更严法规）而加剧损害。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，即使在优先考虑言论自由的法律框架内，法院和学者也广泛承认诽谤法的存在主要是为了保护名誉。这种对其保护能力的基本信念塑造了法律原则，常导致法院边缘化受众在名誉损害发生过程中的作用。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，基于权利的理论将名誉视为财产权、尊严或荣誉的一个方面，而社会视角则将诽谤法视为决斗的文明替代品。相比之下，经济理论关注公众，将名誉定义为有助于预测行为和评估潜在互动伙伴的集体意见。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，名誉是基于过往行为对未来行为的预测性信号，能降低互动中的搜寻成本。他指出，人们认为诽谤法主要通过阻止虚假主张、为受害者提供补救措施，并通过公开查明真相的法律程序恢复名誉来保护名誉。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，由于法院的局限性和《第一修正案》对言论自由的优先考虑，诽谤法的构建有意不阻止每一种虚假陈述或赔偿每一位受害者。因此，法院为言论提供“呼吸空间”，容忍某些滥用，并通过不愿授予禁令以及在诽谤案件中施加更高的证明标准来体现这一点。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，现代诽谤法固有地在平衡个人名誉保护与《第一修正案》的言论自由权利之间挣扎，这一紧张关系在《纽约时报》诉沙利文案中得到了著名阐述。他指出诽谤法的古老起源，从苏美尔泥板和《圣经》等早期文本中的道德教诲演变为正式的法律惩罚，例如法兰克《萨利克法典》中的规定。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，诽谤法历史上从古代刑罚和英国普通法发展而来，口头诽谤（slander）和书面诽谤（libel）最初规则各异，后合并为现代侵权行为，但仍保留某些区别。现行法律原则要求存在公开的、可能损害名誉的虚假陈述，“公开”指传达给第三方，这将其与单纯的情感困扰区分开来。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳たん·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，传统诽谤法要求向第三方发布虚假陈述，最初推定陈述为虚假，真实性则作为抗辩理由。《纽约时报》诉沙利文案这一里程碑式的判决将诽谤法“宪法化”，规定公职人员须证明“实际恶意”，并确立真实性作为免除责任的一般绝对抗辩。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，诽谤性言论是诉讼中的一个关键要素，它通过引发负面评价和减少与主体的联系来损害名誉。然而，法院在规范层面处理名誉问题，评估某一陈述在假想的“可敬”社区看来是否“倾向于”造成损害，而非关注实际发生的损害。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，如果一项陈述因其荒谬性而令理性人难以置信，法院可能认定其不构成诽谤，这突显了通过更严格诽谤法保护名誉的难度。他指出，对保护不足的担忧因目前存在广泛未受管制的诽谤言论领域（如观点、关于公职人员的陈述及第三方在线内容）而有所缓解。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，诽谤法常因匿名言论等问题而效力不彰，导致一些人认为即使废除该法，受害者的处境也不会显著恶化。相反，他指出，由于自由、社会效益以及相信受众能辨别某些不准确之处，支持保护观点表达（即使包含虚假信息）已形成强烈共识。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，传统诽谤模型认为言者的虚假陈述直接造成损害，这一模型存在问题，因为它忽视了受众评估真实性的能力。他强调，诽谤损害是由受众介导的——言论必须被相信才会造成损害——并且应将受众视为理性评估者，而非虚假信息的被动接受者。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，尽管公众对未经证实的说法持怀疑态度并努力寻求真相，但法院和历史人物都承认人们易受欺骗。他打算研究受众在名誉损害中的积极作用所带来的后果，并为诽谤法提出了一个三方模型（言者、受害者、受众）。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，名誉之所以重要，在于存在不可观察的质量差异，他以顾客容忍一家低质量餐馆20%风险的情景为例。在他的模型中，顾客会遇到了解真实质量并能提供评论的前雇员；这些关于质量的事实断言可能具有法律上的可诉性。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，诽谤法之所以必要，是因为人们有时会说谎。他引入一个模型，其中前雇员诋毁雇主的动机（“v”）各不相同，将他们分为“诚实的”（不从诽谤中获益）或“不诚实的”（从中获得低或高价值），以分析诽谤法的影响。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文描述了一个假设的“D0”世界，其中诽谤法非常薄弱，受害者因成本高昂、赔偿极少或证明要求严苛而无法就虚假陈述寻求法律救济。在这种情况下，一个受到虚假中伤的餐馆老板将无从起诉。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，诚实的前雇员会如实报告餐馆质量，但在宽松的法律环境下，不诚实的前雇员总会给出负面评价以损害前雇主，而不论真实质量如何。在一个假设的雇员分布情况下，不诚实的雇员会大量增加负面评价，其中许多是对优质企业的虚假中伤。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，在一个假设情境中，顾客可以信任餐馆的正面评价，因为心怀不满的员工很少提供虚假赞扬。然而，当看到负面评价时，顾客意识到在没有强力诽谤法的情况下虚假信息频发，可能会计算出其准确性仅为38%，这可能仍在他们可接受的风险水平之内。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，在诽谤法宽松（D0）的情况下，由于评论缺乏可信度，消费者可能仍会光顾受到负面评价的餐馆。然后，他将其与一个具有严格诽谤法（D1）的世界进行对比，在D1世界中，假定业主会对虚假的负面评论提起诉讼，尽管诚实员工的行为保持不变。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，诽谤法虽非完美威慑，但可以阻止一些不诚实的员工虚假中伤优质餐馆，促使他们因担心诉讼而发表真实的正面评价。然而，动机极强的不诚实个体，如心怀极大不满的员工，即使面临法律风险，仍可能继续诽谤优质企业。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，顾客即使意识到在存在诽谤法的情况下某些负面评论仍可能失实，但他们可能仍将这些评论视为真正低质量的更重要信号。如果感知到受负面评价的餐馆质量差的概率（例如55%）超过顾客的风险阈值（例如40%），他们很可能会避开该餐馆。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，扩大诽谤法的适用范围反而可能损害优质服务提供者，因为较少的虚假负面评论会赋予其余评论更高的可信度，导致顾客避开那些受到虚假诋毁的优质商家。相反，薄弱的诽谤法会导致大量虚假负面信息，降低整体评论的可靠性，因此顾客常常忽略它们并光顾优质企业。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，更严格的诽谤法通过减少虚假陈述，反而可能提升公众对整体陈述的信任度，使人们更容易受到任何残余虚假信息所带来的更大伤害。这种“跷跷板效应”意味着，数量更少但更可信的谎言可能导致受众因普遍信任度的提高而更容易被欺骗并基于虚假信息采取行动。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，更严格的诽谤法并非总能保护名誉，有时甚至可能有害，这质疑了其明确扮演保护角色的假设。他的分析侧重于对名誉的行为影响，而非涉及多个利益相关者和事前考量的更广泛的社会福利问题。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，尽管目前存在对过度信任虚假信息的担忧，但更严格的诽谤法可能通过增强陈述的可靠性而提供一种未被认识到的优势。他认为，即使公众不了解或误解诽谤法的具体细节，仅凭法律已改变的一般（可能不正确的）信念，也可能产生显著的受众效应。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，诽谤法改革不仅影响言者的行为，也会引起听众公众的行为变化，这一方面需要分析。虽然受众可能非理性地信任，通过锚定等认知偏差使虚假信息具有“粘性”，但他认为虚假信息不太可能具有如此强的说服力以至于完全否定受众的感知和理性。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，虚假信息的“粘性”——即其抵抗反驳的程度——决定了政策应优先考虑减少谎言的数量还是其可信度。他指出，针对虚假信息的执法和诉讼程序存在缺陷且成本高昂，这意味着说谎的动机依然存在，因为受害者在获得补救方面面临巨大障碍。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，加强诽谤诉讼的可执行性会减少谎言数量，但由于受众效应和“跷跷板原则”，反而会导致数量更少但危害更大的虚假信息。他补充说，反对说谎的社会/道德规范会增加诚实言者的数量，从而提高陈述的基线可信度，而诽谤法的变化会影响相对于此基线的可靠性。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，虽然诽谤法能阻止一些虚假陈述，但它反而可能提高那些未被阻止的虚假陈述的可信度，从而可能损害名誉。他还指出，诽谤法的次要目标是为受害者提供救济，并观察到现行法律常常导致他们获得的赔偿不足。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，将诽谤法作为名誉损害的救济手段来辩护是有缺陷的，因为它忽视了法律如何影响受众认知，从而助长了损害的发生。他引用埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）利用弗农·恩斯沃斯（Vernon Unsworth）未提起诉讼作为其所谓有罪的证据，说明了诽谤法如何能被用作损害而非保护名誉的武器。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，诽谤案中的金钱赔偿可能加剧其旨在修复的损害，其益处必须结合受众效应进行评估。他还认为，通过驳斥指控来恢复名誉的说法存在“循环论证”的缺陷——诽谤法本身可能因使受众相信最初的虚假信息而创造了恢复名誉的需求。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，诽谤法的“恢复名誉”理据受到“固化效应”（败诉会强化虚假陈述）和“反向证明”（未能起诉暗示有罪）的削弱。这些问题，加上“循环论证”，挑战了诽谤法通过恢复名誉来明确保护名誉的合理性，要求对此类主张进行特定领域的分析。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，诽谤法在雇佣关系领域更为严格，损害个人职业的陈述本身即可诉（actionable per se），提供了特别的保护。这种强化保护至关重要，因为前雇主的虚假陈述可能造成毁灭性后果，即使指控为真的可能性很小，风险规避型的潜在雇主也可能拒绝提供工作。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，对于即使只有轻微可能性为真也会造成严重损害的虚假指控（如犯罪或“可憎疾病”的指控），可能有必要制定更严格的诽谤法，包括本身即可诉的保护，以减少此类指控。他认为，在消费者市场，此类法律的理由较弱，因为“J形”评论分布中，虚假负面评论常被正面评论所淹没，且通过互动验证主张对司法准确性构成挑战。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，对于消费者评论，应有反对或至少反对扩大诽谤责任的推定，因为高昂的诉讼成本可能阻碍其作为公共产品的产生。对于政治言论，尽管存在“虚假新闻”的担忧，他认为诽谤法通常应让位于言论自由，部分原因是公众对此类问题的认识会减轻某些损害。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，典型的诽谤法宪法分析（言论自由 vs. 名誉）是不完整的，因为更强的法律反而可能通过促成数量更少但更可信的谎言（相对于数量更多但可信度较低的谎言）来损害名誉。他敦促法院在扩大诽谤法适用范围前，权衡减少虚假陈述是否值得残余谎言变得更具危害性和可信度这一代价。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，法官倾向于高估诽谤法的益处，因为他们着眼于其对名誉的总影响，而非考虑到“跷跷板效应”后的较小净效应，这可能改变疑难案件的判决结果。鉴于宪法对言论自由的保护，他认为在不确定是否应扩大诽谤法适用范围时，法院应倾向于言论自由，因为认为诽谤法固有保护名誉的观点存在缺陷，且可能适得其反。
    *   阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授撰文指出，更强的诽谤法可能无意中使人们更加信任未经核实的陈述，从而使残余的虚假信息更具危害性。他希望未来的学术研究能推动在诽谤法判例中明确考虑受众效应，特别是在涉及匿名网络言论时法律的相关性问题。
