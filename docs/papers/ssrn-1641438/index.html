  "abstract": "How is a right to specific performance of a contract used by parties? Despite longstanding scholarly interest in the topic, this question has been largely left unexplored. This Article presents a qualitative study of parties and attorneys involved in specific performance litigation. It investigates how parties choose between remedies, whether they negotiate after judgment for specific performance, whether specific performance is implemented, and the difficulties involved in its implementation. The findings reveal important theoretical oversights and challenges to prevailing law. In practice, many plaintiffs opt out of specific performance. This is puzzling as expectation damages are notoriously under compensatory relative to performance. A primary explanation is that it is harder to execute specific relief than a money judgment. Focusing attention on execution provides a valuable lesson: in exactly these circumstances where U.S. law grants specific performance—unique goods—it is least valuable due to a lack of clear standards by which to evaluate performance. Another explanation is lawyer’s bias: attorneys will often advise clients to sue for money damages to ensure easy collection of their own fees.",

## TL;DR
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that specific performance in contract law is often less effective and less frequently sought than theories suggest. His qualitative study in Israel reveals parties avoid it due to enforceability issues, lawyer agency problems, and changing preferences. When pursued, motivations include signaling or post-judgment renegotiation. Findings show practical enforcement difficulties, especially for unique goods, and challenge assumptions in both rights-based and economic theories, highlighting a gap between legal doctrine and real-world litigant behavior and outcomes, necessitating a re-evaluation of its role and efficacy.

## Section Summaries
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that parties often avoid suing for specific performance due to low enforceability, lawyer agency issues, and evolving preferences. When they do seek it, their reasons can extend beyond simply wanting performance, including signaling case strength, aiming for quicker and less costly resolutions, or strategically positioning themselves for post-judgment renegotiation.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his qualitative study shows many plaintiffs choose damages over specific performance due to its difficult execution, especially for unique goods with unclear standards, and sometimes because lawyers prefer damages for easier fee collection. He notes these practices often contradict established theories, as plaintiffs may resist commodifying judgments (challenging economic views) or use the remedy instrumentally for non-performance goals (challenging rights-based views).

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contract law features a core debate between economic analysis, focused on efficiency and welfare, and rights-based theories, centered on morality. These perspectives justify remedies differently: rights-based theories often favor specific performance to uphold promises, while economic theories see remedies instrumentally. He notes both frequently neglect the impact of a victim’s choice among available remedies.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that despite growing empirical work on contract remedies, there&#x27;s a notable gap in understanding parties&#x27; internal views, expectations, and behaviors regarding specific performance. His article addresses this through a qualitative study with litigants and lawyers in Israel, chosen for its legal similarity to the U.S. but with specific performance as the default remedy, offering a unique comparative context.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that enforcing specific performance awards presents significant practical issues, especially for unique goods where quality assurance is difficult without defendant cooperation. Surprisingly, parties often avoid post-judgment renegotiation despite financial incentives, due to animosity and cognitive biases. He notes that many plaintiffs prefer damages over specific performance, contrary to theory, challenging traditional assumptions about remedy choice and post-judgment actions.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Aabama School of Law writes that corrective justice theories need to recognize that specific performance can be under-compensatory, a problem not fixed merely by allowing promisees to choose their remedy. He argues that the legal practice of restricting specific performance to unique goods is flawed, as these are often the situations where its enforcement is most problematic and least effective.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his article examines theoretical literature on contract remedies, highlighting assumptions for later empirical testing, and categorizes this literature into rights-based and economic theories. He explains that rights-based theories, a prominent viewpoint, typically assess the morality of actions based on adherence to pre-existing moral principles, rather than focusing on the consequences of those actions.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contract law faces two major challenges: justifying promise enforcement when promisors resist, and deriving legal remedies from moral principles. He notes various theories attempt to address these, citing Charles Fried&#x27;s duty to keep promises, Randy Barnett&#x27;s consent theory, Thomas Scanlon&#x27;s expectation theory, and Seana Shiffrin&#x27;s virtue ethics approach as examples.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that unlike U.S. law&#x27;s preference for expectation damages, most contract theorists advocate for specific performance as morally superior, arguing a promise to do X entails a duty to perform X. He identifies a common assumption in many rights-based theories: that a specific performance judgment equates to the actual, timely fulfillment of the contractual promise.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a prevalent view suggests specific performance, despite enforceability issues, better safeguards a promisee&#x27;s interests than expectation damages, particularly due to challenges in quantifying damages. He also notes a perspective favoring specific performance because it aims to deliver the actual promised performance, rather than being a means to other ends for the promisee.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that economic theories of contract law prioritize the consequences of legal rules, advocating for remedies that maximize parties&#x27; joint interests and social welfare. He notes opponents argue specific performance can cause inefficient promisor performance, promisee hold-ups, and wasteful pre-breach precautions by promisors.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that proponents support specific performance as it can secure the promisee&#x27;s value, bypass costly damage calculations, and promote breach only when truly efficient, assuming parties will renegotiate inefficient awards. He notes a key economic theory assumption: parties will usually renegotiate specific performance for payment if performance is inefficient, given typically low transaction costs.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contract remedy discussions often assume parties will try to renegotiate after a breach, with the new agreement&#x27;s value meeting or exceeding the original performance value for the promisee. He notes that while remedy efficiency is widely discussed, less attention is paid to how letting promisees choose remedies influences strategic behavior in plaintiff-attorney or plaintiff-court dynamics.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that common law traditionally treats specific performance as exceptional, granted only if damages are inadequate and subject to limitations like hardship or court supervision. His study, influenced by prior research, examines Israel due to its legal system&#x27;s similarity to U.S. law, but with specific performance as the preferred remedy, contrasting with the common law standard.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Israeli contract law, a mix of statutory and common law with U.S. influence, designates specific performance as the default and morally superior remedy, often called &quot;the first and foremost.&quot; He explains that enforcement can involve contempt petitions, with courts having wide discretion to impose financial or criminal sanctions for compliance.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while Israeli and American contract law structures are similar, they differ on remedy prominence, with Israeli law clearly making specific performance the default. His empirical research is an exploratory qualitative study using interviews with Israeli stakeholders, designed to understand the law&#x27;s real-world application due to a lack of prior empirical studies.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his contract remedies study used &quot;maximum variation&quot; sampling as a random representative sample was impractical; thus, results offer insights into diverse groups but not the frequency of observed phenomena. The 18 participants, selected from a commercial database, comprised six private litigants, eleven lawyers, and one magistrate judge involved in specific performance cases.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his research, using semi-structured interviews with twelve lawyers on specific performance cases, seeks to identify phenomena and report generally applicable findings, not statistical distributions. Preliminary results indicate plaintiffs often avoid specific performance due to enforceability concerns, lawyer preference for damages, or changing client needs. When sought, motivations can include strategic signaling or gaining leverage, not just obtaining the item.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contrary to conventional wisdom favoring specific performance, his early research showed parties often avoid it, with it being sought in less than a third of sampled litigated cases. Interviews with lawyers, aimed at understanding a wider range of cases including settlements, revealed they often counsel clients to choose expectation damages instead.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that specific performance is rarely pursued, despite theoretical preference, due to low enforceability; enforcement hurdles create risk and may result in a lower renegotiated value than damages. Another key factor is lawyers&#x27; agency problems, where fee structures can bias attorneys towards money damages, potentially misguiding clients away from specific performance even if it&#x27;s in their best interest.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that attorneys might guide clients from specific performance due to uncompensated work under contingency fees and fee collection issues; damages offer liquidity and allow lawyers to secure fees via a mechanic&#x27;s lien. Additionally, evolving client preferences concerning performance or the opposing party relationship during litigation can diminish specific performance&#x27;s appeal.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that shifts in plaintiff preferences or deteriorating party relationships during litigation can lessen specific performance&#x27;s practical worth, despite high financial value. He notes parties seek specific performance not just for actual performance but also for strategic aims like signaling case strength, reducing procedural expenses, and obtaining leverage for post-judgment renegotiations.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a plaintiff selecting specific performance over damages can powerfully signal their sincerity and case strength to the court. He adds that seeking specific performance can result in quicker and more economical case resolution than pursuing damages, mainly by sidestepping the complicated and costly task of quantifying financial losses.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that plaintiffs might choose specific performance to cut litigation costs and speed up resolution, even if planning to renegotiate later, particularly if parties can better quantify damages than the court. His research interviews showed that the possibility of post-judgment renegotiation—selling adjudicated rights—sometimes motivates parties to seek specific performance, aligning with economic theory.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his research indicates post-judgment renegotiation (PJR) happens in specific performance cases, with some successful instances, though not all parties pursue it. He notes that PJR failures, despite economic incentives, are often due to psychological obstacles like animosity and mistrust developed during litigation between the parties.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that in specific performance cases, party animosity has mixed effects on settlement willingness: it can obstruct agreement via mistrust or drive successful negotiation to end interaction, yet sometimes causes reluctance despite beneficial settlement. He notes the endowment effect is significant, as litigants awarded a specific good/service may feel strong ownership, making them less willing to renegotiate the judgment.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that parties frequently display an &quot;incommensurability bias,&quot; resisting the reduction of judgments to monetary terms and assigning symbolic importance to specific performance, seeing it as distinct from damages. He found individual plaintiffs desired the specific good and were reluctant to monetize their entitlement, whereas lawyers for large firms reported corporate clients easily converted judgments to monetary value.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a surprising scarcity of systematic research exists on post-judgment outcomes of specific performance, fostering a common belief that they lead to promised performance with minimal issues. He notes legal frameworks like the UCC support specific performance&#x27;s compensatory advantage, reserving it for unique goods where monetary damages are deemed insufficient.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that implementing specific performance decrees is frequently problematic, causing many legal interviewees to see the remedy negatively and potentially under-compensatory. He notes factors like increased performance costs and post-litigation animosity can reduce its value, which, unlike expectation damages assuming full completion, should be weighed against potentially subpar ordinary contract execution realities.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contrary to assumptions that animosity undermines specific performance, case findings suggest its practical impact might be overstated, with some parties maintaining good relations post-judgment. Evidence from finance agreements and a custom door dispute indicates that factors ensuring normal contractual performance can remain effective even after a specific performance decree.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that specific performance can be effectively enforced with clear standards, like custom doors with detailed specs, but fails when monitoring is hard and standards are lacking. He notes the irony that a good&#x27;s uniqueness, justifying specific performance, can hinder its effectiveness if quality evaluation becomes difficult, potentially under-compensating the promisee.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that appointing a receiver over a promisor&#x27;s business, though costly (with the defendant paying the receiver&#x27;s salary), can be a useful enforcement method needing more analysis. He notes plaintiffs face substantial, often higher, post-judgment enforcement costs for specific performance than for damages, and their active involvement is vital for actual performance.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that specific performance&#x27;s theoretical edge over damages against judgment-proof defendants is reduced in practice because contempt enforcement often uses financial sanctions, ineffective against low-capitalization defendants. However, he notes a defendant&#x27;s reputational capital can be leveraged for enforcement, especially when financial sanctions are weak due to low capitalization.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a debtor&#x27;s strong reputation, highlighted by interviewed lawyers and prior research, greatly helps enforce court judgments, even if it didn&#x27;t prevent the initial breach. He describes reputation as a complex mechanism for securing compliance and notes that social norms and their resulting pressures are another key, context-dependent leverage for enforcement.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that social pressures affect contract implementation complexly and sometimes contradictorily; thus, social norms, though valuable, shouldn&#x27;t be blindly trusted for enforcement, citing an example of shifting individual resolve. His findings on specific performance litigation impact contract theories, including rights-based ones, which, despite a-priori origins, appear to consider practical consequences of rules, focusing on autonomy over pure economic welfare.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his study shows plaintiffs often use specific performance instrumentally for strategic benefits like hold-up or quicker, cheaper resolution, not just due to broken promises, challenging rights-based theories. He argues common deontological justifications dismissing such uses as immoral or marginal are insufficient, as legal rights address potential moral failures, and his study finds these instrumental uses frequent.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that specific performance frequently isn&#x27;t truly compensatory and can be under-compensatory compared to damages due to costly enforcement, promisor resistance, and promisee liquidity. Consequently, while remedy choice or combining specific performance with damages might better protect promisees, these methods have limitations and strategic issues, requiring re-evaluation of theories favoring specific performance as superior or sole.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that rights-based theories need modification to account for the disparity between the legal right to specific performance and its real-world outcomes, which can have unintended moral and economic consequences. He argues economic theories must reassess specific performance&#x27;s assumed high value, as empirical data shows weak enforcement often yields neither performance nor better compensation than damages.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that specific performance decrees might inadequately deter inefficient breaches and be under-compensatory, questioning their effectiveness compared to damages in prevention or compensation. He notes specific performance can be &quot;stickier&quot; than theorized due to negotiation reluctance from factors like commensurability bias, potentially causing inefficiencies and warranting more judicial caution or greater reliance on expectation damages.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a key legal implication of his research is empirically showing significant weaknesses in enforcing specific performance. Enhancing effectiveness is hard without problematic criminal sanctions or by using more liberal financial sanctions and receivership. This raises policy concerns about when specific performance should be available, questioning its use for unique goods where enforcement is acutely difficult.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the assumed adequacy of specific performance for unique goods is undermined by quality assessment difficulties and limited impact against insolvency, necessitating judicial comparative remedy assessment. To improve outcomes, he suggests judges could permit deficiency judgments, create venues for substandard performance, use discretion in awarding remedies instead of deferring to plaintiffs, and consider resolution time impacts.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that interim remedies&#x27; potential to alleviate problems needs more study, and ethical rules should tackle lawyer agency problems where self-interest in remuneration influences remedy advice. His qualitative study, viewing contractual practices internally, reveals greater complexity than theories suggest, highlighting the need for more empirical data to refine legal theories on specific performance.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that parties may refrain from suing for specific performance more frequently due to concerns about low enforceability, lawyers&#x27; agency problems, and changing preferences over time.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that when parties do pursue specific performance, their motivations can include signaling, achieving faster and cheaper case resolution, or positioning for post-judgment renegotiation.

### Page 2
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his qualitative study reveals many plaintiffs opt out of specific performance because it is more difficult to execute than a money judgment, particularly for unique goods where performance standards are unclear, and sometimes due to lawyers advising clients to sue for damages to facilitate easier collection of their own fees.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his findings also indicate parties&#x27; approaches to specific performance often contradict established theories, such as when plaintiffs resist commodifying a judgment, which challenges economic theories, or when they use the remedy instrumentally for purposes other than achieving contractual performance, which is in tension with rights-based theories.

### Page 3
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a fundamental debate in contract law exists between normative economic analysis, which emphasizes efficiency and social welfare, and rights-based theories, which are more concerned with the morality of actions and intentions.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that these contrasting theories offer different justifications for legal remedies, such as rights-based theories favoring specific performance for ensuring promises are kept, while economic theories view remedies instrumentally, and both often overlook the implications of a victim&#x27;s choice between available remedies.

### Page 4
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that there is a significant lack of understanding regarding parties&#x27; internal perspectives, expectations, and actual behaviors concerning the legal remedy of specific performance, despite a growing empirical literature on contract remedies. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his article aims to address this gap through a qualitative investigation, involving interviews with litigants and lawyers in Israel, a jurisdiction chosen because its contract law is similar to American law but sets specific performance as the default remedy.

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the enforcement of specific performance awards is rife with practical problems, particularly for unique goods where quality is hard to ensure without the defendant&#x27;s goodwill, and that surprisingly, parties often refrain from post-judgment renegotiation of these decrees despite financial incentives due to litigation animosity and cognitive perceptions.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contrary to theoretical expectations, many plaintiffs choose money damages over specific performance, and these findings collectively challenge traditional contract theory assumptions about remedy selection and post-judgment conduct.

### Page 6
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that corrective justice theories must acknowledge the under-compensatory reality of specific performance, an issue not resolved simply by granting promisees a choice between remedies.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the legal practice of limiting specific performance to unique goods is misguided, as these are precisely the scenarios where enforcement is often least effective.

### Page 7
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his article reviews theoretical literature on contract remedies, focusing on assumptions to be empirically examined later, and conventionally divides this literature into rights-based and economic theories.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that rights-based theories, a common and influential perspective, generally judge the morality of choices and actions based on adherence to a-priori moral principles rather than on their consequences.

### Page 8
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contract law grapples with two complex challenges: justifying the enforcement of promises that promisors no longer wish to honor, and deriving specific legal remedies from core moral principles.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that various theories have been developed to address these issues, including Charles Fried&#x27;s concept of a duty to keep promises, Randy Barnett&#x27;s consent theory, Thomas Scanlon&#x27;s expectation theory, and Seana Shiffrin&#x27;s virtue ethics approach.

### Page 9
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that most contract theorists, unlike American law which defaults to expectation damages, argue for specific performance as the morally preferred remedy because a promise to do X implies a duty to actually do X.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a common assumption he identifies in many rights-based contract theories is the treatment of specific performance judgments as a shorthand for the actual, timely performance of the contractual obligation.

### Page 10
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a common view is that specific performance, even accounting for enforceability problems, better protects a promisee&#x27;s interests than expectation damages, especially given difficulties in quantifying the latter.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a third view favors specific performance for awarding the promisee exactly what they expected to receive—performance itself—rather than the judgment being used for other ends.

### Page 11
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that economic theories of contract law focus on the consequences of legal rules, suggesting remedies should be chosen to maximize the parties&#x27; joint interests at the time of contracting based on their effect on overall social welfare. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that opponents argue specific performance can lead to inefficient performance by promisors, potential hold-up scenarios by promisees, and wasteful ex-ante measures by promisors to avoid breach.

### Page 12
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that proponents advocate for specific performance because it can capture the promisee&#x27;s value, avoid costly damage quantification, and encourage breach only when clearly efficient, with the expectation that parties will trade the award if performance proves inefficient.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a common assumption in economic theory is that parties will generally engage in post-judgment renegotiation, trading the right to specific performance for payment if performance is inefficient, facilitated by typically low transaction costs in contractual settings.

### Page 13
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that common assumptions in contract remedy discourse include the expectation that parties will attempt renegotiation after a breach, and that the renegotiated agreement&#x27;s value will generally equal or surpass the original performance value to the promisee.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while much attention is given to the efficiency of various remedies, there is significantly less consideration of how allowing promisees to choose their remedies might affect strategic behavior in plaintiff-attorney or plaintiff-court interactions.

### Page 14
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that in common law, specific performance is traditionally an exceptional remedy, awarded only when monetary damages are inadequate and even then, subject to further limitations such as disproportionate hardship or court supervision.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his study, prompted by earlier scholarship, investigates Israel because its legal system, while similar enough to U.S. contract law for comparison, uniquely features specific performance as the preferred remedy, unlike the common law approach.

### Page 15
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Israeli contract law, an amalgam of statutory legislation and common law influenced by American jurisprudence, establishes specific performance as the default and morally superior remedy for breach, often referred to as &quot;the first and foremost&quot; among all other remedies. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that to enforce specific performance, an aggrieved party can pursue options such as filing a petition for an order of contempt, where courts have broad discretion to impose financial or criminal sanctions to achieve compliance.

### Page 16
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while the general structure of Israeli contract law exhibits strong resemblances to American law, the two systems diverge on the prominence of remedies, with Israeli law unambiguously setting specific performance as the default. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his empirical investigation into this matter is an exploratory qualitative study involving interviews with relevant stakeholders in Israel, chosen to capture the law-as-it-is-experienced given the absence of previous empirical work on this issue.

### Page 17
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his study on contract remedies employed a “maximum variation” sampling approach because acquiring a random statistically representative sample was unfeasible, meaning the results provide insight into different groups but are not representative of the frequency of the phenomena described.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the 18 participants chosen for the research, from cases reported to a commercial database, included six private parties involved in specific performance litigation, eleven lawyers, and one magistrate judge.

### Page 18
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his research, based on semi-structured interviews with twelve lawyers about their experiences in specific performance cases, aims to identify the existence of certain phenomena and report findings believed to be of general application, rather than to represent the statistical distribution of all such cases.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that preliminary findings from these interviews suggest plaintiffs often opt-out of specific performance—contrary to its theoretical higher value—due to concerns about enforceability, attorney preference for money damages, or evolving client needs during litigation, and even when seeking specific performance, motivations may include strategically signaling case strength or gaining negotiation leverage rather than solely obtaining the contracted item.

### Page 19
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while conventional wisdom suggests plaintiffs would favor suing for specific performance in breach of contract cases, his early research indicated that parties often abstain, with specific performance sought in significantly fewer than one-third of sampled litigated cases. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that interviews with lawyers, conducted to understand the broader population of cases including settlements, further revealed that they frequently advise clients to opt for expectation damages over specific performance.

### Page 20
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that despite theoretical preference, specific performance is infrequently sued due to low enforceability, as impediments to judgment enforcement mean it carries risk and might yield a lower renegotiated value than expectation damages. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that another significant reason for this deviation is a lawyers&#x27; agency problem, where attorneys may have a systematic bias towards money damages due to fee structures, potentially steering clients away from specific performance even when it serves the client&#x27;s best interest.

### Page 21
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that attorneys may steer clients away from specific performance because it involves significant uncompensated work under contingency fees and presents fee collection challenges, unlike damages where liquidity is assured and lawyers can secure fees with a mechanic&#x27;s lien. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that changing client preferences over the duration of litigation, regarding the actual performance or the relationship with the opposing party, can also make specific performance a less desirable remedy.

### Page 22
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that changes in a plaintiff&#x27;s preferences or the deterioration of the relationship between parties during litigation can reduce the practical value of specific performance, even if its direct financial value remains high.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that parties sue for specific performance not only for the commonly assumed reason of wanting the actual performance, but also for strategic purposes such as signaling case merit, minimizing procedural costs, and gaining leverage in post-judgment renegotiations.

### Page 23
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a plaintiff&#x27;s choice of legal remedy, such as opting for specific performance over monetary damages, can significantly signal the perceived sincerity of their motives and the strength of their case to the court.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that pursuing specific performance can lead to a much faster and cheaper case resolution compared to seeking damages, primarily because it avoids the complex and expensive process of quantifying financial losses.

### Page 24
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that plaintiffs may opt for specific performance suits to reduce litigation costs and expedite resolution, even if they anticipate renegotiating the decree later, especially when parties are more adept than the court at quantifying damages.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that interviews conducted for his research revealed that parties are sometimes motivated to seek specific performance by the prospect of post-judgment renegotiation, where they can sell their adjudicated rights, a finding consistent with economic theory.

### Page 25
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his research on contract remedies shows that post-judgment renegotiation (PJR) in specific performance cases does occur, with instances of successful PJR reported, although it is not consistently pursued by all parties. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the failure of PJR in some specific performance cases, despite potential economic benefits, is often linked to psychological barriers such as animosity and mistrust that develop between parties during litigation.

### Page 26
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that in specific performance cases, animosity between parties has conflicting effects on their willingness to negotiate a settlement, as it can both hinder agreement due to mistrust and motivate successful negotiation to avoid prolonged interaction, yet sometimes leads to reluctance even when settlement is beneficial.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the endowment effect is particularly relevant in specific performance contexts, as litigants who receive a court judgment for an actual good or service may develop a strong sense of ownership and entitlement, making them more reluctant to renegotiate that judgment.

### Page 27
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that parties often exhibit an &quot;incommensurability bias,&quot; meaning they avoid reducing judgments to mere monetary value and attach symbolic meaning to specific performance, viewing it as qualitatively different from damages.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while individual plaintiffs expressed a desire for the specific good and were hesitant to monetize their contractual entitlement, lawyers for large firms indicated their corporate clients readily reduced judgments to their monetary value.

### Page 28
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that there is a surprising lack of systematic research on what actually happens after specific performance judgments are entered, leading to a common impression that they simply result in the originally promised performance with few implementation issues.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that legal frameworks, such as the Uniform Commercial Code, endorse the view that specific performance offers a comparative advantage in compensation, reserving it for cases like unique goods where monetary damages are considered inadequate.

### Page 29
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the practical implementation of specific performance decrees is often fraught with difficulties, leading many legal interviewees to view this remedy negatively and find it potentially under-compensatory for the promisee.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that factors such as increased performance costs and post-litigation animosity can diminish the value of specific performance, which, unlike expectation damages that assume full completion, should be assessed against the reality of potentially sub-par ordinary contract execution.

### Page 30
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that despite common assumptions that animosity would undermine specific performance, case findings suggest that its practical importance may be exaggerated, with some parties reporting excellent relationships and cooperation even after a judgment.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that evidence from cases, such as a finance agreement and a consumer dispute over a custom door, indicates that the same underlying drivers that ensure contractual performance in ordinary circumstances can continue to operate effectively even after specific performance has been judicially decreed.

### Page 31
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while specific performance can be effectively enforced by verifying a finished product against clear standards, as demonstrated in a case involving custom doors with detailed specifications, this approach falters when performance is difficult to monitor and quality standards are absent. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the very uniqueness of a good, which initially justifies specific performance, can paradoxically undermine the remedy&#x27;s effectiveness if it makes quality evaluation difficult, potentially leaving the wronged party under-compensated.

### Page 32
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that appointing a receiver over a promisor&#x27;s business can be a useful, albeit costly, method to enforce performance, with the defendant bearing the receiver&#x27;s salary, though further analysis is needed. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that plaintiffs bear significant post-judgment costs for enforcement, which are often higher for specific performance than damages, and in practice, their active approach is crucial for the judgment to be performed.

### Page 33
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the theoretical advantage of specific performance over expectation damages for judgment-proof defendants is diminished in practice, as enforcement via contempt of court often relies on financial sanctions which are ineffective against those with low capitalization, thus limiting its added value.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a defendant&#x27;s reputational capital can, however, be leveraged to enforce specific performance judgments, which is particularly useful when financial sanctions are unlikely to be effective due to a defendant&#x27;s low capitalization.

### Page 34
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a debtor&#x27;s strong reputation, as emphasized by interviewed lawyers and supported by previous research, significantly aids in enforcing court judgments even if it did not prevent the initial contractual breach.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that reputation is a complex and nuanced mechanism in securing obedience to court orders, and that social norms, along with the social pressures they generate, represent another significant, context-dependent source of leverage for ensuring compliance.

### Page 35
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that social pressures can influence contract implementation in complex and sometimes contradictory ways, meaning that while social norms can be valuable, they should not be blindly relied upon to ensure enforcement, as demonstrated by an individual who initially felt shame for breaching a contract but gained strength when others joined his stance. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his findings on specific performance litigation carry implications for contract theories, including rights-based approaches, which, despite being often derived from a-priori principles, seem to consider the consequences of legal rules in practice, albeit by focusing on aspects like autonomy rather than purely economic welfare.

### Page 36
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his study indicates plaintiffs often use specific performance instrumentally for strategic advantages like hold-up or faster, cheaper case resolution, rather than solely due to disappointment from a broken promise, which challenges rights-based theories.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that common deontological justifications for specific performance, which might dismiss these instrumental uses as morally impermissible or marginal, are inadequate because legal rights are established precisely due to potential moral failures, and his study suggests such uses are relatively frequent.

### Page 37
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that specific performance often fails to be truly compensatory, and may even be under-compensatory relative to expectation damages, due to factors like costly enforcement, promisor resistance, and promisee liquidity issues.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that consequently, while a choice of remedy or a combination of specific performance with damages might better protect promisees, these approaches have their own limitations and strategic complexities, necessitating a re-evaluation of theories that advocate for specific performance as a superior or sole remedy.

### Page 38
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that rights-based theories require modification to address the significant gap between the legal right to specific performance and its actual outcomes, which can produce unintended moral and economic effects.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that economic theories, which rely on consequences, must re-evaluate the assumed high value of specific performance due to empirical evidence showing weak enforcement often results in neither actual performance nor superior compensation compared to damages.

### Page 39
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that specific performance decrees may under-deter inefficient breaches and prove under-compensatory, challenging the notion that they are as effective as monetary damages in preventing such breaches or fully compensating promisees.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that specific performance can be &quot;stickier&quot; than theoretically supposed due to an unwillingness to negotiate, driven by factors like commensurability bias, which may lead to inefficiencies and call for greater judicial caution or increased use of expectation damages.

### Page 40
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a primary legal implication from his research is the empirical demonstration of the significant frailty in enforcing specific performance decrees, and that enhancing its effectiveness is challenging without problematic criminal sanctions or by adopting more liberal financial sanctions and receivership. Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that consequently, a related legal policy concern arises regarding the circumstances under which specific performance should be available, questioning its current common application to unique subject matter contracts where enforcement difficulties are particularly acute.

### Page 41
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the presumed adequacy of specific performance for unique goods is challenged by difficulties in judging performance quality and its limited effectiveness against a defendant&#x27;s insolvency, requiring judges to comparatively assess remedies.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that to improve outcomes, judges could allow deficiency judgments, establish venues for addressing sub-standard specific performance, exercise discretion in awarding remedies rather than deferring to plaintiffs, and consider the impact of resolution times.

### Page 42
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the potential of interim remedies to mitigate problems merits further investigation, and that ethical rules should address the agency problem where lawyers might give self-interested advice on remedies due to their own remuneration potential.
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his qualitative study, examining contractual practices from litigants&#x27; and lawyers&#x27; internal viewpoints, shows these practices are more complex than theorized, underscoring the need for more empirical data to refine legal theories and debates, especially concerning specific performance.</pre>

## TL;DR

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that specific performance in contract law is often less effective and less frequently sought than theories suggest. His qualitative study in Israel reveals parties avoid it due to enforceability issues, lawyer agency problems, and changing preferences. When pursued, motivations include signaling or post-judgment renegotiation. Findings show practical enforcement difficulties, especially for unique goods, and challenge assumptions in both rights-based and economic theories, highlighting a gap between legal doctrine and real-world litigant behavior and outcomes, necessitating a re-evaluation of its role and efficacy.
