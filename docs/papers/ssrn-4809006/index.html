  <h2>Summary (English)</h2>
  <pre class="md">Here is the bullet list for &#x27;ssrn-4809006&#x27; by Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law, based on the provided excerpts:

## TL;DR ≤100 words
Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues for critically examining and updating legal doctrines by incorporating factors like time in contract interpretation, the profound societal and legal impacts of AI (including &quot;AI Lies&quot; in ssrn-4809006), and economic or behavioral insights into legal practice and individual rights. He challenges static views and advocates for dynamic, context-aware approaches to emerging legal challenges and established principles, from unbundling legal services to understanding copyright in the age of generative AI and the subtleties of price obfuscation and information disclosure.

## Section Summaries ≤120 words each

1.  **The Great Unbundling:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the legal profession is undergoing the &quot;Great Unbundling,&quot; where traditional legal services are disaggregated into smaller, specialized components. He states this shift, driven by technology, client demands, and regulatory changes, offers opportunities for increased access and efficiency but also poses significant challenges regarding quality control, ethics, and the profession&#x27;s identity.
2.  **Contract Creep:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that boilerplate contractual terms like arbitration clauses and class action waivers are insidiously spreading into diverse legal fields beyond consumer contracts, a phenomenon he terms &quot;contract creep.&quot; He argues this expansion of contractual ideologies into non-contractual areas, often without meaningful assent, erodes established public norms and individual rights.
3.  **Time and Contract Interpretation (Historical Evolution):** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contrary to viewing contract interpretation as timeless, it is deeply intertwined with and shaped by the passage of time. He demonstrates how interpretive methodologies are not static but evolve through distinct historical eras, reflecting shifts in legal theory, economic conditions, and societal values.
4.  **Contract Interpretation Theories (Textualism, Contextualism):** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contract interpretation, a muddled affair, primarily seeks to divine parties’ intent through textualism (plain meaning of written words) and contextualism (welcoming extrinsic evidence due to word ambiguity). He also introduces a &quot;half&quot; theory of modified textualism, allowing limited contextual analysis for ambiguities or trade terms.
5.  **Static Interpretation Fallacy:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that current contract interpretation theories suffer from a &quot;Static Interpretation Fallacy&quot; by largely ignoring time and how term meanings and context evolve after contract formation. He proposes a &quot;Dynamic Interpretive Framework&quot; that explicitly incorporates the temporal dimension for more accurate and equitable adjudications.
6.  **The Cost of Thinking:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that this paper challenges the perception of thinking as a &#x27;free good,&#x27; arguing cognitive effort carries significant hidden expenses. He posits these unacknowledged costs (e.g., reduced productivity, decision fatigue, health detriments) lead to misallocated mental resources and suboptimal outcomes if not properly understood.
7.  **Contract Interpretation: Meaning vs. Intent Prediction:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that traditional contract interpretation focuses on the objective meaning of words at contract formation, often downplaying subjective intentions. He notes an alternative perspective views interpretation as predicting parties&#x27; unstated intentions, reconstructing the hypothetical bargain for unconsidered contingencies.
8.  **Textualism&#x27;s Limits and Context:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while textualists might envision a &quot;lawyer&#x27;s Paradise&quot; with fixed word meanings, this overlooks language&#x27;s inherent defectiveness. In contrast, he states interpretation always occurs within a context, with pre-existing interpretive assumptions shaping understanding even for seemingly unambiguous sentences.
9.  **Inherent Uncertainty in Contractual Language:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contractual language is inherently uncertain, as words lack self-evident meanings and rarely convey identical understanding to all parties. Consequently, he argues courts must invariably consider extrinsic evidence of surrounding circumstances to ascertain intended meaning before determining legal rights.
10. **Precision vs. Accuracy in Legal AI:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that precision in legal AI refers to the consistency and repeatability of its outputs, distinct from its correctness. Accuracy, conversely, measures how closely AI outputs correspond to true legal outcomes, highlighting that an AI can be precise without being accurate.
11. **Static Nature of Current Interpretation Doctrines:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that current contract interpretation doctrines, like the plain meaning rule and parol evidence rule, are fundamentally static tools struggling with how contractual terms&#x27; meaning and context change over time. He proposes a dynamic approach, introducing &quot;temporal dynamics&quot; to better address evolving contracts and interpretations.
12. **Contracting with Language Models:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his article is the first to systematically explore implications of contracting with language models (LMs) integrated into the contracting lifecycle. While LMs offer efficiency, he notes they introduce novel challenges (interpretability, reliability, accountability), proposing enhanced human oversight and adapted legal frameworks.
13. **Textualism, Contextualism, and Time:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the textualism versus contextualism debate in contract interpretation overlooks time&#x27;s crucial dimension. He argues textualism&#x27;s precision is initially superior in deterring litigation, but as unforeseen contingencies arise, contextualism&#x27;s flexibility becomes more valuable for achieving accuracy over a contract&#x27;s life.
14. **Contract Law in the Age of AI:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that AI&#x27;s integration into contractual processes fundamentally challenges contract law due to AI&#x27;s &quot;black box&quot; nature, potential &quot;hallucinations,&quot; and manipulation susceptibility, undermining doctrines reliant on human intentionality. His paper explores these impacts on contract stages and broader issues of autonomy, efficiency, and fairness.
15. **Bias-Variance Tradeoff in Contract Interpretation:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the statistical bias-variance tradeoff offers a framework for analyzing the tension between formalist and contextualist contract interpretation. Bias is an interpretive rule&#x27;s systematic deviation from true intent; variance captures outcome unpredictability, with an inherent tradeoff between them.
16. **AI Judges and the Future of Justice:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that integrating AI judges, while challenging, holds promise for revolutionizing justice administration through potential unparalleled efficiency and consistency. He emphasizes that realizing this requires carefully navigating formidable ethical, due process, and societal hurdles of AI judicial decision-making.
17. **Quantitative Analysis in &quot;Time and Contract Interpretation&quot;:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes about &quot;Time and Contract Interpretation,&quot; noting a specific page includes mathematical formulas for Bias squared (Bias²) and Variance. He also mentions the year 1992, indicating a quantitative or historical data aspect to his analysis.
18. **Generative AI as Contract Interpreter:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contract interpretation is intractable due to language&#x27;s vagueness, ambiguity, and incompleteness, leading to costly, error-prone human processes. He suggests Large Language Models (LLMs) offer &quot;Computational Contract Interpretation,&quot; potentially analyzing contracts with greater speed and consistency.
19. **Temporal Contract Interpretation Framework:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contracts are inherently temporal, yet dominant interpretation theories largely overlook this, treating them as static. His article challenges this by proposing a new framework for temporal contract interpretation, distinguishing *ex ante* (formation meaning) and *ex post* (evolved meaning) interpretation.
20. **LLMs: Interpretation versus Simulation in Contracts:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Large Language Models&#x27; key innovation in contract interpretation is simulating how contractual language would likely operate in practice—what the contract *does* by modeling party behavior. This contrasts with traditional interpretation seeking to understand what the contract *means*.
21. **Challenging &#x27;Point-in-Time&#x27; Contract Interpretation:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contract law has long assumed meaning is fixed at formation (the &#x27;point-in-time&#x27; approach). His Article challenges this, arguing meaning evolves and interpretation should adapt, proposing a &#x27;dynamic interpretation&#x27; framework.
22. **The Paradox of Disclosure:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes about the &quot;paradox of disclosure,&quot; positing that individuals disclosing *more* information can, counterintuitively, enhance their privacy. He explains this occurs because widespread disclosure can make specific information common, less distinctive, and thus less valuable for targeting by reducing its signal.
23. **Consent and Knowledge in Intimate Arrangements:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that if one party is confident another prefers a new arrangement, informing them without explicit consent isn&#x27;t a breach when there&#x27;s no uncertainty about interests. He notes intimates, with deeper mutual knowledge, can reliably act on evolving understandings, adopting an ex-post view of their arrangements.
24. **Generative AI and Copyright Infringement:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that generative AI models trained on vast copyrighted materials create a conflict between AI developers claiming fair use and creators alleging infringement. He argues current copyright law is ill-suited, and training AI on copyrighted works fundamentally constitutes infringement, with fair use an unlikely defense.
25. **Contracts as &quot;Time-Traveling Devices&quot;:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contract interpretation&#x27;s difficulty, with textualist/contextualist struggles, stems from failing to appreciate *time&#x27;s* crucial role. He proposes that understanding contracts as &quot;time-traveling devices&quot; for an uncertain future can reframe the debate and offer novel solutions.
26. **&quot;AI Lies&quot; and Societal Risk (SSRN 4809006):** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that current AI systems frequently generate false, misleading, or fictitious outputs, termed &quot;AI Lies&quot; to emphasize their harmful impact over mere &quot;hallucinations.&quot; He warns that as AI integrates into critical life aspects, these &quot;AI Lies&quot; pose a significant, widespread societal risk.
27. **The &quot;Problem of Time&quot; in Contract Interpretation:** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that contract interpretation faces a &quot;problem of time&quot;: whether to use word meanings from drafting (T1) or litigation (T2). While prevailing originalism (T1) is favored, he challenges this, arguing it can be suboptimal and proposes a new framework considering contractual language&#x27;s temporality.
28. **Price Obfuscation in Online Markets (Linked to SSRN 4809006 by user):** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that price obfuscation in online markets systematically disadvantages consumers, leading to overpayment and reduced market efficiency by hindering comparisons. He suggests existing legal frameworks are ill-equipped, needing interventions like enhanced disclosure and stricter enforcement.
29. **Temporal Interpretation of Contracts (Linked to SSRN 4809006 by user):** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that traditional static contract interpretation, focused on original intent, is incomplete. He argues time actively shapes contractual meaning, advocating for a &quot;temporal interpretation&quot; framework considering evolving language, performance history, and changing contexts for an adaptive, equitable approach.
30. **Scholarly Foundations (References in SSRN 4809006):** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his research (implicitly for ssrn-4809006) is built upon referencing a diverse range of scholarly works. These include studies on language, pragmatics, plain meaning, contractual silence, the UCC, foundational linguistics (Saussure), contract interpretation analyses (Posner, Mitchell), and modern machine learning studies.
31. **Temporal Decay and Plain Meaning (Linked to SSRN 4809006 by user):** Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that time&#x27;s passage systematically erodes contract interpretation accuracy, increasing judicial error risk due to factors like fading memories and shifting linguistic contexts. To counteract this, he suggests courts should increasingly favor a contract&#x27;s plain meaning as it ages, anchoring interpretation in more stable evidence.</pre>

## 内容摘要 (≤100词)
阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授主张，应通过纳入诸如合同解释中的时间因素、人工智能（AI）深远的社会和法律影响（包括SSRN-4809006号论文中讨论的“人工智能谎言”）以及经济学或行为学洞见应用于法律实践和个人权利等因素，来批判性地审视和更新法律原则。他挑战静态观点，倡导采用动态的、关注具体情境的方法来应对新兴的法律挑战和既定原则，其研究范围从法律服务的分拆，到生成式人工智能时代的版权理解，乃至价格混淆和信息披露的微妙之处。

## 各节摘要 (每节≤120词)

1.  **大分拆 (The Great Unbundling)：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授指出，法律行业正在经历“大分拆”，即传统法律服务被分解为更小、更专业的组成部分。他表示，这一由技术、客户需求和监管变化驱动的转变，为提高法律服务的可及性和效率提供了机遇，但同时在质量控制、职业道德和行业身份认同方面也带来了重大挑战。
2.  **合同蔓延 (Contract Creep)：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授指出，诸如仲裁条款和集体诉讼豁免等格式化合同条款，正悄然蔓延至消费者合同以外的多个法律领域，他将此现象称为“合同蔓延”。他认为，这种合同意识形态在通常未经当事人有意义同意的情况下向非合同领域的扩张，侵蚀了既有的公共规范和个人权利。
3.  **时间与合同解释 (历史演进)：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授指出，与将合同解释视为永恒不变的观点相反，它与时间的流逝紧密交织并受其塑造。他证明了解释方法并非静止不变，而是随着法律理论、经济条件和社会价值观的变迁，在不同的历史时代中演进。
4.  **合同解释理论 (文本主义、语境主义)：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授指出，合同解释这一棘手问题，主要通过文本主义（书面文字的字面含义）和语境主义（因词语模糊性而采纳外部证据）来探求当事人的意图。他还介绍了一种“半”理论，即修正的文本主义，允许在出现歧义或行业术语时进行有限的语境分析。
5.  **静态解释谬误 (Static Interpretation Fallacy)：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授指出，当前的合同解释理论因普遍忽略时间因素以及合同订立后条款含义和语境如何演变而存在“静态解释谬误”。他提出了一个“动态解释框架”，明确纳入时间维度，以实现更准确和公平的裁决。
6.  **思考的成本 (The Cost of Thinking)：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授指出，本文挑战了将思考视为“免费品”的观念，认为认知努力带有显著的隐性成本。他假定，这些未被承认的成本（例如，生产力下降、决策疲劳、健康损害）若未得到正确理解，会导致心智资源错配和次优结果。
7.  **合同解释：含义 vs. 意图预测 (Meaning vs. Intent Prediction)：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授指出，传统合同解释侧重于合同订立时词语的客观含义，往往轻视主观意图。他注意到另一种观点认为，解释旨在预测当事人未言明的意图，为未曾考虑到的意外情况重构假设的交易。
8.  **文本主义的局限性与语境 (Textualism&#x27;s Limits and Context)：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授指出，尽管文本主义者可能设想一个词义固定的“律师天堂”，但这忽略了语言固有的缺陷性。相反，他指出解释总是在特定语境下进行，即使对于看似 unambiguous（ unambiguous 可译为“ unambiguous ”或“清晰明确”）的句子，预设的解释性假设也会塑造理解。
9.  **合同语言的内在不确定性 (Inherent Uncertainty in Contractual Language)：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授指出，合同语言具有内在的不确定性，因为词语缺乏不言自明的含义，并且很少能向所有当事方传递完全相同的理解。因此，他认为法院在确定法律权利之前，必须始终考虑周围情况的外部证据以确定预期含义。
10. **法律人工智能的精确度与准确度 (Precision vs. Accuracy in Legal AI)：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授指出，法律人工智能的精确度指其输出结果的一致性和可重复性，这与其正确性不同。相反，准确度衡量人工智能输出结果与真实法律结果的符合程度，强调了人工智能可能做到精确但并不准确。
11. **当前解释原则的静态本质 (Static Nature of Current Interpretation Doctrines)：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授指出，当前的合同解释原则，如字面含义规则和口头证据规则，本质上是静态工具，难以应对合同条款含义和语境随时间变化的问题。他提出了一种动态方法，引入“时间动态”以更好地处理演变中的合同和解释。
12. **与语言模型订立合同 (Contracting with Language Models)：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授指出，其文章首次系统探讨了将语言模型（LM）整合到合同生命周期中所产生的影响。虽然语言模型能提高效率，但他指出它们也带来了新的挑战（可解释性、可靠性、问责制），并提议加强人工监督和调整法律框架。
13. **文本主义、语境主义与时间 (Textualism, Contextualism, and Time)：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授指出，合同解释中关于文本主义与语境主义的争论忽略了时间这一关键维度。他认为，文本主义的精确性在初期对阻止诉讼更为优越，但随着不可预见意外情况的出现，语境主义的灵活性在合同有效期内对于实现准确性变得更有价值。
14. **人工智能时代的合同法 (Contract Law in the Age of AI)：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授指出，人工智能融入合同流程从根本上挑战了合同法，原因在于人工智能的“黑箱”特性、潜在的“幻觉”以及易受操控性，这些都削弱了依赖于人类意向性的法律原则。其论文探讨了这些影响对合同各个阶段以及更广泛的自主性、效率和公平性问题。
15. **合同解释中的偏误-方差权衡 (Bias-Variance Tradeoff in Contract Interpretation)：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授指出，统计学中的偏误-方差权衡为分析形式主义和语境主义合同解释之间的张力提供了一个框架。偏误是解释规则与真实意图之间的系统性偏差；方差则捕捉了结果的不可预测性，两者之间存在固有的权衡。
16. **人工智能法官与司法的未来 (AI Judges and the Future of Justice)：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授指出，整合人工智能法官虽然具有挑战性，但通过其潜在的无与伦比的效率和一致性，有望彻底改变司法管理。他强调，实现这一点需要审慎应对人工智能司法决策所带来的艰巨的伦理、正当程序和社会障碍。
17. **《时间与合同解释》中的定量分析 (Quantitative Analysis in &quot;Time and Contract Interpretation&quot;)：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授在论及《时间与合同解释》时提到，其中某一页包含偏差平方 (Bias²) 和方差的数学公式。他还提及1992年，这表明其分析中包含定量或历史数据方面的内容。
18. **作为合同解释器的生成式人工智能 (Generative AI as Contract Interpreter)：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授指出，由于语言的模糊性、歧义性和不完整性，合同解释问题非常棘手，导致人工处理成本高昂且易出错。他提出，大型语言模型（LLM）可提供“计算合同解释”，可能以更高的速度和一致性分析合同。
19. **时间性合同解释框架 (Temporal Contract Interpretation Framework)：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授指出，合同本质上具有时间性，然而主流解释理论在很大程度上忽略了这一点，将其视为静态的。其文章通过提出一种新的时间性合同解释框架来挑战此观点，区分了事前解释（合同成立时的含义）和事后解释（演变后的含义）。
20. **大型语言模型：合同中的解释与模拟 (LLMs: Interpretation versus Simulation in Contracts)：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授指出，大型语言模型在合同解释中的关键创新在于模拟合同语言在实践中可能如何运作——即通过模拟当事人行为来揭示合同*实际做什么*。这与传统解释试图理解合同*意味着什么*形成对比。
21. **挑战“特定时间点”合同解释 (Challenging &#x27;Point-in-Time&#x27; Contract Interpretation)：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授指出，合同法长期以来假定合同含义在成立时即已固定（“特定时间点”方法）。其文章对此提出挑战，认为含义会演变，解释也应随之调整，并提出了一种“动态解释”框架。
22. **披露的悖论 (The Paradox of Disclosure)：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授论述了“披露的悖论”，即个人披露*更多*信息反而可能增强其隐私。他解释说，这是因为广泛披露可以使特定信息变得普遍，不再独特，从而因降低其信号价值而使其对于定向获取的价值降低。
23. **亲密关系中的同意与知情 (Consent and Knowledge in Intimate Arrangements)：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授指出，如果一方确信另一方更喜欢新的安排，在对利益没有不确定性的情况下，告知对方而未经明确同意并不构成违约。他指出，拥有更深相互了解的亲密关系者可以可靠地基于演变的理解采取行动，对他们的安排采取一种事后观点。
24. **生成式人工智能与版权侵权 (Generative AI and Copyright Infringement)：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授指出，基于大量受版权保护材料训练的生成式人工智能模型，在声称合理使用的人工智能开发者与指控侵权的创作者之间造成了冲突。他认为现行版权法不适用此情况，并且在受版权保护作品上训练人工智能从根本上构成侵权，合理使用不太可能成为有效的抗辩理由。
25. **合同作为“时间旅行装置” (Contracts as &quot;Time-Traveling Devices&quot;)：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授指出，合同解释之所以困难，以及文本主义与语境主义的争议，源于未能认识到*时间*的关键作用。他提出，将合同理解为针对不确定未来的“时间旅行装置”，可以重构这场辩论并提供新的解决方案。
26. **“人工智能谎言”与社会风险 (SSRN 4809006) (&quot;AI Lies&quot; and Societal Risk (SSRN 4809006))：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授指出，当前的人工智能系统经常生成虚假、误导性或虚构的输出，他称之为“人工智能谎言”，以强调其有害影响而非仅仅是“幻觉”。他警告说，随着人工智能融入生活的关键领域，这些“人工智能谎言”构成了重大且广泛的社会风险。
27. **合同解释中的“时间问题” (The &quot;Problem of Time&quot; in Contract Interpretation)：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授指出，合同解释面临一个“时间问题”：是应采用起草时（T1）的词义还是诉讼时（T2）的词义。虽然普遍倾向于采用原始主义（T1），但他对此提出质疑，认为这可能并非最优选择，并提出了一个考虑合同语言时间性的新框架。
28. **在线市场中的价格混淆 (Price Obfuscation in Online Markets) (用户标注与SSRN 4809006相关)：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授指出，在线市场中的价格混淆系统性地使消费者处于不利地位，通过妨碍比较导致消费者支付过高价格并降低市场效率。他认为现有法律框架对此准备不足，需要采取诸如加强信息披露和更严格执法等干预措施。
29. **合同的时间性解释 (Temporal Interpretation of Contracts) (用户标注与SSRN 4809006相关)：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授指出，侧重于原始意图的传统静态合同解释是不完整的。他认为时间主动塑造着合同含义，倡导一种“时间性解释”框架，该框架考虑不断演变的语言、履约历史和变化的环境，以实现一种适应性强且公平的方法。
30. **学术基础 (SSRN 4809006中的参考文献) (Scholarly Foundations (References in SSRN 4809006))：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授指出，他的研究（默认为SSRN 4809006）建立在对广泛学术著作的参考之上。这些著作包括关于语言、语用学、字面含义、合同沉默、美国《统一商法典》(UCC)、基础语言学（索绪尔）、合同解释分析（波斯纳、米切尔）以及现代机器学习研究的文献。
31. **时间衰减与字面含义 (Temporal Decay and Plain Meaning) (用户标注与SSRN 4809006相关)：** 阿拉巴马大学法学院的约纳坦·阿尔伯教授指出，时间的流逝会系统性地侵蚀合同解释的准确性，由于记忆衰退和语言语境变化等因素，增加了司法错误的风险。为应对此问题，他建议法院应随着合同年代的久远而越来越倾向于采纳合同的字面含义，将解释锚定在更稳定的证据之上。</pre>
