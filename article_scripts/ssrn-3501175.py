1.  ## TL;DR
    Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that a small group of hyper-persistent consumers, dubbed "nudniks," play a crucial role in market discipline by actively challenging seller misconduct, benefiting all consumers. However, sellers increasingly use big data to identify and neutralize these nudniks, undermining accountability. Arbel calls for legal strategies to protect this vital "nudnik-based activism" and preserve its positive spillovers, shifting focus from mythical contract-readers to these real-world enforcers of market norms.

2.  ## Section Summaries

    ### 1. Defining "Nudniks" and Their Motivations
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that "nudniks" are hyper-persistent consumers with idiosyncratic utility functions who challenge seller misconduct *ex post*, even when costs outweigh benefits, acting where most remain passive.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that distinct from passive consumers or pre-purchase focused "shoppers," nudniks are driven by fairness, spite, or ideology, often being derided despite their crucial role.

    ### 2. The Beneficial Role of Nudniks in Market Governance
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nudniks act as engines of market discipline, generating positive spillovers by publicly airing grievances, litigating, and creating reviews, thus deterring unfair practices and enforcing market norms benefiting all.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that their actions solve collective action problems, provide monitoring for sellers, and can compel broad policy changes, enhancing both legal and reputational deterrence for the passive majority.

    ### 3. The Rising Threat: Seller Strategies to Disarm Nudniks
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that sellers increasingly use big data and predictive analytics to identify, profile, and preemptively neutralize "nudniks," often before any transaction, shielding themselves from accountability.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that firms leverage detailed consumer data to predict complaint likelihood and then disarm nudniks through tailored remedies, by muffling their voices, or by avoiding or "gagging" them.

    ### 4. Diluting Market Discipline: The Impact of Nudnik Neutralization
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that sellers neutralizing "nudniks" early significantly dilutes legal and reputational deterrence by preventing public dissemination of misconduct through reviews, media, or litigation.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that this practice undermines review system informativeness, hinders consumer protection law development, and may incentivize appearance management over actual quality, harming passive consumers.

    ### 5. Nudnik Activism: A More Robust Model of Market Discipline
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nudnik-based activism offers a robust model of market discipline, superior to theories reliant on unrealistic assumptions about consumer contract reading or general reputational awareness.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that this model is resilient because a single determined nudnik can effect change, amplified by digital platforms, and they operate outside typical cost-benefit analyses, undeterred by rising activism costs.

    ### 6. Justifying Nudnik Activism: Addressing Concerns and Overall Benefit
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while some nudnik complaints may seem petty, evidence suggests they often highlight real defects relevant to many, and their resolution can even boost customer loyalty.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that nudniks' social impact is judged by outcomes—pushing firms towards fairness—not motivations, and their actions, even if exposing minor individual issues, can reveal significant collective harm.

    ### 7. Preserving Nudnik Activism: Legal and Policy Responses
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that legal intervention is crucial to protect "nudnik-based" market discipline from seller neutralization tactics, as existing laws are often inadequate for "nudnik-targeting."
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that solutions include adapting laws like the Consumer Review Fairness Act, empowering regulators, and ensuring judicial interpretations recognize nudniks' societal benefits to protect information flows and optimize their activism.
