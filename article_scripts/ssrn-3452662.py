*   **Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that** regulations on information exchange often neglect how audiences adapt their beliefs and actions based on the strictness of laws governing statement veracity. His research addresses this "audience gap" by employing a Bayesian game to model interactions among speakers, targets, and audiences, specifically investigating how legal strictness influences their behavior and the overall information environment.

1.  ## TL;DR ≤100 words
    Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that information regulation often overlooks how audiences adjust their beliefs and actions based on the strictness of laws governing statement veracity. His research aims to address this "audience gap" by using a Bayesian game to model interactions between speakers, targets, and audiences, particularly examining how legal strictness impacts their behavior and the resulting information landscape.

    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the common approach to regulating information exchange has a significant blind spot: it often fails to account for the dynamic ways in which audiences adapt. Specifically, how audiences adjust their beliefs and subsequent actions is directly influenced by the perceived strictness of the laws that govern the truthfulness of statements. This oversight can lead to miscalibrated regulations.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his research endeavors to fill this identified "audience gap" in the understanding of information regulation. To do so, he utilizes a Bayesian game framework. This model simulates the interactions between three key parties—speakers, the targets of statements, and the audiences receiving them—with a particular focus on how varying degrees of legal strictness regarding statement veracity shape the strategic behaviors of all involved.
