**1. TL;DR ≤100 words**

Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that the current consumer debt litigation system is failing due to prevalent unmeritorious claims and consumer inability to defend themselves. He proposes "Adminization," where an administrative agency acts as a cost-effective gatekeeper, using sampling and AI to audit lawsuits and levy large fines against those filing baseless claims. This aims to deter abuse, enhance judicial efficiency, and provide meaningful oversight, offering a more just and economically viable solution than existing court-based approaches or proposed reforms like expanded legal aid.

**2. Section Summaries ≤120 words each**

*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that because large companies and debt collectors file numerous unmeritorious claims against consumers who lack resources to defend themselves, leading to millions of default judgments and rendering courts ineffective, he proposes "Adminization"—an administrative agency acting as a cost-effective gatekeeper that samples cases and levies large fines for baseless claims to deter such wrongful behavior.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that an introductory anecdote about Margaret Donnelly, an elderly widow facing severe legal repercussions for a small, unnotified debt, illustrates a systemic problem where vulnerable individuals are caught off-guard by consumer credit legal actions, highlighting a fundamental flaw in the justice process for these cases.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a significant crisis exists with millions of consumers facing abusive debt collection lawsuits, many lacking merit or concerning already settled debts, particularly targeting those unable to afford legal representation; this is worsened by consumer difficulties in accessing courts, resulting in numerous default judgments with minimal judicial oversight.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the current system for consumer debt disputes is broken, evidenced by penalties against financial institutions for filing false affidavits and pursuing fraudulent debts; to combat this, he proposes "Adminization," where a gatekeeper administrative agency would audit a sample of debt collection cases pre-litigation and issue large fines for fraud, deterring wrongful behavior.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that under his proposal, consumer protection agencies would be notified of all incoming lawsuits, using administrative powers to audit a small fraction and fine abusers. Case selection would initially be random to ensure all creditors face potential detection, similar to IRS practices, but could later be enhanced by machine learning to target statistically high-risk cases.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that "Adminization" proposes an administrative agency to gatekeep civil litigation, using methods like fraud detection algorithms or random selection, as a departure from traditional court-focused solutions. He criticizes current participation-based solutions within the adversarial model as unworkable, arguing they would require prohibitively costly reforms and overwhelm the already burdened court system if implemented at scale.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Adminization offers an economically and politically appealing solution to pressures on traditional legal aid, employing sampling techniques for efficient case audits to manage large volumes and deter wrongful suits, thereby offsetting operational costs. His article contributes by proposing Adminization as a normatively attractive solution for unmeritorious consumer litigation, a model for reducing abusive claims in other areas with power asymmetries, and by exploring AI for case selection.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the growing strain on judicial resources and the decline of full civil trials indicate the need for, and promise of, utilizing algorithmic decision-making within the legal process. His "Adminization" model highlights important, yet unexplored, complementarities between courts and agencies, challenging the traditional view that administration and civil litigation are inherently inconsistent.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his proposed 'Adminization' framework is designed to overcome major legal and economic hurdles by leveraging existing regulatory agencies, which minimizes legal concerns, manages costs, and reduces regulatory capture. Adminization also aims to appeal to creditors by potentially increasing consumer confidence and market legitimacy, thereby prevailing over alternative solutions in terms of effectiveness, cost, and justice.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that consumer credit contracts, such as for credit cards or hospital bills, allow deferred payment; if consumers default, creditors typically begin with informal collection methods like dunning letters and phone calls. During this stage, creditors leverage credit reporting alongside psychological and social pressure, though many unpaid debts ultimately escalate to lawsuits, which constitute a majority of civil litigation.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that consumer credit litigation is extremely prevalent, with millions of lawsuits filed annually in the U.S. and an estimated one in three Americans facing potential lawsuits or having accounts in collections. This type of litigation is processed through an adversarial system, which operates on the "sporting theory of justice"—positing that truth emerges from the self-interested participation of conflicting parties before a judge.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that systematic consumer underparticipation in credit litigation invites fraud and abuse, with regulators consistently finding banks and debt buyers filing nonmeritorious lawsuits, forging affidavits, and pursuing time-barred debts. Further evidence of this pervasive abuse includes the significant number and nature of consumer complaints regarding debt collection practices, such as demanding money that is not actually owed.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that consumers file hundreds of thousands of complaints annually with regulators like the FTC and CFPB concerning the debt collection process, particularly when claims escalate to lawsuits. These complaints predominantly involve allegedly invalid debts, abusive communications, and illegal threats, aligning with expert opinions that the industry is rife with abuse and unfairly targets vulnerable demographics, including the elderly.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a striking lack of necessary evidence from plaintiffs in debt collection lawsuits is a significant indicator of abuse, with one judge estimating this occurs in ninety percent of cases and an empirical study finding no evidence at all in forty-six percent. When evidence is produced, its quality is often very poor, frequently lacking crucial details like debt breakdown or payment history, and much of it is "facially invalid," consistent with concerns about practices like "robo-signing."
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the frequent lack of evidence for debts, particularly when owned by parties not involved in the original transaction, strongly suggests that many collection lawsuits are nonmeritorious. He also notes strong evidence of abuse in the notification process, exemplified by "sewer service," where debt collectors falsely claim to have served summonses to secure default judgments.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a substantial body of evidence, including studies and legal cases, points to a serious and persistent problem with faulty service of process, leading to an "astonishing" number of default judgments. This improper service often involves false affidavits or the overuse of methods like "nail and mail" and delivery to other household members, which are intended as last resorts rather than standard practice.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that consistent evidence from various sources, coupled with theoretical grounds of moral hazard, indicates that fraud and abuse in consumer credit litigation represent a serious problem. Simultaneously, consumers often find courts inaccessible, leading to very low rates of response to lawsuits, appearance in court, and acquisition of legal representation.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a significant number of litigants, particularly debtors, proceed pro se (1.8 million in New York in 2014 alone) against almost universally represented creditors, creating a power imbalance that often leads to unfavorable settlements where debtors relinquish legally protected assets. These participation gaps are attributed to debtors' lack of resources, sophistication, and legal knowledge, which also burdens the court system and presents access problems even in informal small claims courts.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that consumer apathy towards the legal process is often a rational response because the substantial costs of full participation, including lost wages and attorney fees, frequently exceed the potential benefits. With average consumer law attorney fees around $361 per hour, leading to total costs of $800-$1,600 for an average case, paid representation is often unviable when the case value is similar, and proceeding pro se remains challenging.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a significant lack of judicial oversight exists in consumer credit cases, as the vast majority, potentially millions annually, result in default judgments with minimal scrutiny. One factor contributing to this limited oversight is the adversarial nature of the legal process, which restricts judges’ investigative authority and exacerbates informational problems for the court.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that structural issues like consumer inexperience, rational apathy, and psychological barriers, combined with creditors' advantages as repeat players and overloaded civil courts, lead to low judicial scrutiny in consumer debt cases. This system, where private settlements often yield worse results for consumers and judges frequently rubberstamp agreements, ultimately functions as an "incubator of abuse" by incentivizing unmeritorious or inflated claims with minimal oversight.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that he proposes "Adminization," a model of civil litigation designed for cost-effective oversight by leveraging administrative agencies that operate independently of user participation to address flaws in current consumer protection. This system would feature a gatekeeper agency using powers like sampling, audits, and fines to investigate cases and sanction plaintiffs with baseless claims, thereby protecting consumers and reducing unwanted litigation.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his concept of Adminization challenges the traditional jurisprudential view that posits a fundamental tension between the individualized justice of civil litigation and the generic, bureaucratic management by agencies. He argues this traditional emphasis overlooks much that is complementary and productively coexistent, with Adminization focusing on the optimal design of institutions that promote due process, efficiency, and justice.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Adminization, a concept designed to enhance civil litigation, involves three central features run by a central agency: audits and fines, sampling, and third-party communications. The "audits and fines" feature entails the agency proactively investigating claims by collecting evidence, interviewing witnesses, and assessing the claim's validity, operating similarly to how the EEOC functions.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that government agencies like the EEOC, IRS, and CFPB possess broad investigatory powers, enabling them to acquire considerable information and handle a vast number of cases annually. He notes that despite seeming wasteful, agency-led information collection is highly attractive because agencies can direct parties to pertinent evidence and access information, such as agency records or third-party data, that may be unavailable to individuals.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that agencies can use audits to inspect cases for plausibility and signs of abuse, such as false evidence or unverified debts, and can complement these with fines against baseless claims to sanction noncompliant behavior even with defendant underparticipation. While this system of audits and fines provides a bulwark against abuse where underparticipation is an issue, the prohibitive cost of auditing all cases necessitates strategies like sampling and artificial intelligence for resource management.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that unlike civil litigation where judges must attend to all cases, administrative agencies can strategically allocate attention and resources, exemplified by the IRS's selective in-depth reviews. Agencies utilize various sampling methods, including random sampling, which is simple but may waste resources, or criteria-based sampling, which risks being gamed or costly to prescreen.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that smart sampling, a promising approach, uses Big Data and artificial intelligence with machine learning algorithms to identify cases statistically most likely to involve fraud based on the resolution of similar past cases. This method offers speed, low cost, and potential accuracy, and its complex "black box" nature makes it difficult for market participants to game, with similar AI-assisted fraud detection already in use privately and being developed by agencies like the SEC.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that AI technology in the credit card industry effectively detects fraud by evaluating millions of daily transactions in real time against consumer models, flagging suspicious deviations with low error rates. He notes another telling example of AI's success is spam filtering, where algorithms have overcome the vast richness of human communication to identify spam, a problem previously considered nearly impossible for computers to solve.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Google's Gmail demonstrates the power of statistical algorithms by filtering ninety-nine percent of spam with very low rates of false positives, resulting in less than 0.1 percent of inbox email being spam. He also cites Benford’s law as another example, which can detect potential accounting fraud by identifying unnatural distributions in the leading digits of reported numbers, a principle software can expand upon with more sophisticated, multi-faceted rules.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that developing sophisticated rules for Adminization requires a large body of labeled training data, which is readily available from existing judicial records or "systemic facts." Furthermore, the Adminization process itself would constantly produce new data through its audit system, allowing the machine learning algorithm to self-modify and continuously improve based on the results.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Adminization, where an agency handles service of process and communications, would directly solve structural problems of private service by informing defendants of their rights and providing educational materials, a task for which agencies are better suited. He suggests this concept can be applied to consumer credit litigation, with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) being a particularly appealing agency due to its scale and broad existing powers.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) could implement a debt claim process where claimants submit rudimentary information about the debt, sufficient for an unsophisticated consumer to assess, while acknowledging they hold supporting evidence. The agency would then use an automated machine learning system to screen these claims, checking for issues like time-barred debts or excessive interest, and automatically reject those with clear violations to filter out invalid "zombie debts."
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his proposed system will employ "smart sampling" using algorithms that synthesize statistical information about creditors, debtors, and case characteristics to identify debt collection cases most likely to involve fraud or abuse. These flagged cases would then be investigated by agency auditors who can demand proof, contact consumers, and, if wrongdoing is found, levy significant fines against the plaintiff, subject to appeal.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the use of audits and fines can provide consumers with basic protection by eroding the harsh consequences of underparticipation and sanctioning fraudulent or unsupported claims. Following this, all cases should proceed to a “Communication” stage where the agency, not the plaintiff, contacts consumers with simple, clear forms that explain the claim and provide options to admit, contest, or ignore it.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his proposed system allows consumers to respond to debt claims by paying, offering settlement, or easily contesting them via checkboxes, with creditors only needing to provide full evidence if the case proceeds to litigation. The outcomes of these contested or ignored cases would then be fed into machine learning algorithms for future improvements and used to manage an internal creditor reputation score, influencing audit frequency.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Adminization complements litigation by significantly curtailing unmeritorious claims through potential fines, leading to cost savings for the judicial system and deterring frivolous lawsuits. This system also benefits creditors by increasing the reliability of consumer credit contracts and consumers by making credit a safer, more accessible option, especially for those in poverty, with costs offset by reduced litigation.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that participation-based solutions, which aim to incentivize consumer involvement to provide judges with information, generally entail immense costs for only marginal benefits when compared to administrative review. He cites "lawyering up" through public subsidies for legal services as a prominent example intended to increase consumer assertion of rights and inform judges, but argues for a higher return on investments in administrative screening mechanisms.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the proposal to provide a "civil Gideon" right, offering attorneys to indigent individuals in civil proceedings, is unworkable, prohibitively costly, and of marginal effectiveness. He argues the immense cost stems from the staggering number of potentially eligible individuals, estimated at tens of millions nationwide, many of whom face multiple legal issues, far exceeding conservative cost projections.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that by analyzing the actual costs of existing legal aid institutions, such as New York's IOLA fund which reported a per-case cost of $897, current projections for national legal aid expenses are likely underestimated by at least an order of magnitude. He calculates that if this per-case cost were applied to the approximately thirty-two million Americans eligible for assistance, the annual cost would amount to $28.7 billion.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while restricting legal aid to consumer credit cases might lower costs, this reduction is unlikely to be substantial due to challenges in classifying complaints and the sheer volume of such litigation. He notes that means or merit testing offer more promising cost-reduction avenues, yet they introduce their own difficulties, including setting appropriate thresholds, the paradox of merit testing, administrative burdens, and potential applicant stigma.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that legal aid in this context faces extremely high costs, and attempts to reduce these costs involve difficult compromises that either diminish testing effectiveness or restrict aid, largely maintaining the status quo. He argues the benefits of such legal aid are quite limited because most cases are not genuinely disputed, potentially drowning valid defenses in noise, and creditors would likely counter-invest in legal services, further diluting any positive impact.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that a common proposal to have judges actively intervene in litigation to level the playing field for consumers is problematic due to uncertainty about whether inquisitorial systems yield better results and concerns about judicial confirmation bias. This approach would also necessitate fundamental changes to legal education and training, and he highlights the troubling costs, as judges performing lawyers' duties could be more expensive than public subsidies for private lawyers.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that some propose modifying legal procedures to mitigate evidentiary problems by requiring plaintiffs, like creditors, to assert detailed knowledge and produce more evidence for their claims. He views this as a poor solution, arguing that without meaningful judicial scrutiny to verify evidence, such requirements are wasteful and unlikely to improve outcomes.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that high evidentiary bars in debt collection cases risk deterring meritorious lawsuits and result in redundant evidence production, given that most such cases are undisputed. He argues that on the margin, it would be more productive to invest in administrative audits to ensure fairness rather than categorically requiring high evidentiary standards in all debt collection cases.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that proposals to change the venue of consumer credit cases, such as shifting them to general civil or federal courts or restricting court access, are unlikely to resolve core issues and may even exacerbate problems like abuse in informal collection. He also finds procedural reforms aiming to directly regulate plaintiff behavior, like requiring affidavits or enhanced service documentation, problematic as they depend on creditors whose financial incentives often misalign with intended consumer protections.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while consumer arbitration theoretically offers benefits like overcoming complex procedures and reducing costs, it ultimately fails to solve the structural issues that 'Adminization' addresses, particularly in consumer credit litigation. This failure stems from arbitration being a contractual instrument, which tends to replicate market dynamics where creditors draft agreements and influence arbitrator choice, thus structurally impeding fair outcomes for consumers.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that arbitration has largely failed to improve consumer protection, citing prohibitive costs for consumers with small claims, outcomes overwhelmingly favoring creditors, and evidence of arbitrator shopping. While the alternative of class defense, which consolidates dispersed defendants to make defending claims more cost-effective, shows greater potential, it is unlikely to fully resolve these problems due to the narrow criteria for class actions.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that even if reforms successfully encouraged a large portion of consumers to contest unfair charges and abuses in court, this would constitute a pyrrhic victory as the legal system would be unable to support such a significant increase in litigation. Any moderately successful reform bringing more consumers to court would encumber the already overwhelmed courts with potentially millions of new cases each year.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that accommodating a potential surge in consumer credit cases would require a massive, potentially unsustainable increase in the civil legal system's capacity and national expense. Beyond these direct costs, he foresees unseen consequences, including debtors being more inclined to defend less meritorious cases and creditors finding small claims less worthwhile to pursue due to increased litigation expenses.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Adminization is intended to complement, not substitute, litigation, with both systems working in tandem to improve outcomes and reduce costs in addressing multicausal consumer protection problems. While using agencies like the FTC and CFPB for Adminization might introduce some legal issues, he believes these concerns are surmountable as these bodies already possess foundational legal authority, such as that granted to the CFPB by the Dodd-Frank Act, to oversee consumer protection.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that federal agencies like the FTC and CFPB possess significant legislative authority, including under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, to investigate, bring lawsuits, levy fines, and supervise financial entities to curb unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices in consumer debt collection. These broad powers, which explicitly cover even purely intrastate abusive debt collection, are intended to support the "Adminization" of consumer debt litigation and enable enforcement against a wide array of regulated entities.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the regulatory reform concept of "Adminization" could achieve political success by appealing to diverse interests, including those on the consumer side seeking robust protection. He suggests Adminization would also be appealing to creditors, who stand to gain from a streamlined process, greater consumer confidence, and increased legitimacy in debt collection.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that Adminization offers a politically feasible approach because its mutual advantages for debtors and creditors could garner greater support than alternatives, as evidenced by a similar successful reform in Israel where creditors and consumers united. However, he acknowledges a key concern is the potential for regulatory capture, where creditor interest groups might lobby and unduly influence the administrative agency.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that concerns about regulatory capture in "Adminization" are unconvincing, as many agencies operate without being hopelessly captured, consumers also mobilize politically, and the proposed system merely adds a layer to court proceedings, diminishing the benefit of capture. He also notes that the challenge regarding the costs of running the agency is not critical, particularly because utilizing the existing CFPB platform would mean low set-up costs.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the cost of audits for 'Adminization', estimated using a Fermi approach at roughly $700 per case and totaling around $44.8 million, is significantly lower than leading alternatives and potentially cheaper than the current system. He adds that another source of cost, algorithm development, would largely be a one-off expenditure, suggesting that 'Adminization' could be a financially viable system.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that objections to public funding for 'Adminization' in private financial matters overlook the substantial existing government subsidies for the current court system, making the true issue one of optimal subsidy allocation. He argues that civil litigation, particularly in consumer credit, is plagued by systemic failures such as predatory practices and inadequate judicial oversight, which enables the "success method"—the strategic filing of unmeritorious claims due to lax screening.
*   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his proposed solution of "Adminization" introduces a new regulatory mode using a gatekeeper agency for oversight where participation is systematically lacking, offering robust due process, cost-effectiveness, and potential broad political support. This system would grant consumers greater access to justice and creditors increased market confidence, with future applications envisioned in diverse areas like housing, employment law, and civil rights, making it a forward-looking regulatory model.
