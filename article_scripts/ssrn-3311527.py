1.  ## TL;DR ≤100 words
    Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law argues that expanding defamation law is misguided. He contends that such expansions overlook crucial "audience effects," where stricter laws can paradoxically harm reputations by making any remaining false statements appear more credible. This increased believability means attempts to fight "fake news" by strengthening defamation law could backfire. Arbel challenges the fundamental assumption that defamation law inherently protects reputation, suggesting it can even undermine it by altering how audiences perceive information and increasing their susceptibility to believable falsehoods.

2.  ## Section Summaries ≤120 words each

    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his co-authored article, "The Case Against Expanding Defamation Law," examines the objectives and workings of defamation law, its relationship with reputation, and, critically, how "audience effects"—the way audiences perceive statements—shape the law's effectiveness and its appropriate boundaries.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the widely held belief that defamation law safeguards reputation is flawed because it ignores "audience effects"—how the law shapes audience perception. He argues that stricter defamation laws can paradoxically damage reputations by making statements seem more reliable, implying that expanding these laws to combat fake news could prove counterproductive.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that concurrent political pressures to bolster libel laws, exemplified by figures like then-President Trump, and a new American Law Institute project on defamation, signal potentially imminent, significant changes to the law. He notes these calls for expansion, involving reduced safeguards and higher damages, are largely based on the prevailing theory that defamation law's primary function is reputation protection.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the prevalent "reputation-protection theory" suggests stricter defamation laws, by penalizing falsehoods, protect reputations from damaging comments. His article, however, critiques this theory, highlighting its failure to account for significant "audience effects" – how the audience's perception of statements is influenced by the legal framework itself.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that traditional defamation law is deficient as it neglects the "audience effect," meaning harm isn't direct but mediated by third-party perception of negative statements. Applying signaling theory, he explains that stricter defamation laws can enhance the perceived reliability of statements, because the higher cost of falsehoods (due to increased legal risk) makes these "signals" appear more credible than "cheap talk."
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that stringent defamation law can paradoxically harm reputations because audiences, perceiving a tougher legal environment, are more inclined to believe any false statements that still surface, deeming them more reliable. His proposed trilateral framework (speaker, victim, audience) uncovers a "seesaw dynamic": stricter laws reduce false statements but concurrently boost the credibility and potential harm of those that remain.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that expanding defamation law can paradoxically render audiences more credulous and vulnerable to remaining falsehoods, as they might assume a more regulated, truthful information environment. Consequently, he advises policymakers to balance the harm prevented by fewer lies against the harm from lies becoming more believable, advocating for a default to free speech if a net benefit from expansion isn't clear.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that his analysis indicates defamation law is not as protective of reputation as commonly believed, requiring a re-assessment of First Amendment considerations to favor free speech more strongly. He further warns that expanding libel laws to fight "fake news" could paradoxically worsen harm by creating a false public confidence in the truthfulness of published material due to perceived stricter regulation.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that defamation law is broadly recognized by courts and scholars as existing mainly to protect reputation, even within a legal framework prioritizing free speech. This fundamental belief in its protective capacity has molded legal doctrine, often causing courts to marginalize the audience's role in how reputational harm occurs.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that rights-based theories see reputation as an aspect of property, dignity, or honor, while social perspectives view defamation law as a civilized substitute for duels. In contrast, economic theories focus on the public, defining reputation as collective opinions that help predict behavior and assess potential partners in interactions.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that reputation acts as a predictive signal of future conduct based on past behavior, reducing search costs in interactions. He notes defamation law is believed to protect reputation mainly by deterring false claims, offering redress to victims, and allowing vindication through legal proceedings that publicly ascertain truth.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that defamation law is intentionally structured not to deter every falsehood or compensate every victim, owing to court limitations and First Amendment priorities for free speech. Consequently, courts provide "breathing space" for speech, tolerate some misuse, and show this through reluctance to grant injunctions and by imposing higher proof standards in defamation cases.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that modern defamation law inherently struggles with balancing individual reputation protection against First Amendment free expression rights, a tension famously addressed in *New York Times Co. v. Sullivan*. He notes defamation's ancient origins, evolving from moral teachings in early texts like Sumerian tablets and the Bible to formal legal penalties, such as in the Frankish Lex Salica.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that defamation law developed historically from ancient penalties and English common law, where spoken slander and written libel initially had distinct rules before merging into the modern tort, though some distinctions remain. Current doctrine requires a public, false statement likely to harm reputation, with "public" meaning communication to a third party, differentiating it from mere emotional distress.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that defamation traditionally necessitated a false statement published to a third party, with falsity initially presumed and truth serving as a defense. The pivotal *New York Times v. Sullivan* ruling "constitutionalized" defamation law, mandating public officials prove "actual malice" and establishing truth as a general absolute defense against liability.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that defamatory speech, a key element in lawsuits, damages reputation by causing negative opinion updates and reduced association with the subject. However, courts treat reputation normatively, assessing if a statement "would tend" to cause harm in the view of a hypothetical "respectable" community, rather than focusing on actual occurred harm.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that courts might find a statement non-libelous if its absurdity makes it unbelievable to rational people, underscoring the difficulty of protecting reputation via stricter defamation laws. He notes concerns about inadequate protection are tempered by existing broad unregulated areas for defamatory speech, such as opinions, statements about public officials, and third-party online content.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that defamation law's frequent ineffectiveness, challenged by issues like anonymous speech, leads some to argue its removal would minimally worsen victims' situations. Conversely, he notes a strong consensus supports protecting opinion expression, even with falsehoods, due to liberty, social benefits, and the belief that audiences can discern some inaccuracies.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the traditional defamation model, where a speaker's false statement directly causes harm, problematically overlooks the audience's ability to assess truth. He emphasizes that defamation harm is mediated by the audience—speech must be believed to be damaging—and audiences should be seen as rational evaluators, not passive recipients of falsehoods.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that despite public skepticism towards unverified claims and efforts to find truth, both courts and historical figures recognize people's susceptibility to deception. He intends to investigate the consequences of the audience's active role in reputational harm, suggesting a trilateral model (speaker, victim, audience) for defamation law.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that for reputation to matter, unobservable quality variations must exist, illustrated by a scenario where patrons tolerate a 20% risk of a low-quality restaurant. In his model, patrons encounter ex-employees with knowledge of true quality who can give reviews; these factual assertions about quality could be legally actionable.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that defamation law is necessary because people sometimes lie. He introduces a model where ex-employees have different motivations ("v") for denouncing employers, categorizing them as "honest" (no value from besmirching) or "dishonest" (low or high value from it), to analyze defamation's effects.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes about a hypothetical "D0" world with very weak defamation law, where victims cannot seek legal redress for false statements due to high costs, minimal damages, or stringent proof requirements. In this scenario, a falsely maligned restaurant owner would have no recourse to sue.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that honest ex-employees report truthfully on restaurant quality, but in a lax legal environment, dishonest ones will always give negative reviews to harm former employers, irrespective of true quality. Given a hypothetical employee distribution, dishonest employees substantially inflate negative reviews, many falsely maligning good establishments.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that in a hypothetical scenario, patrons can trust positive restaurant reviews since disgruntled employees rarely offer false praise. However, upon seeing a negative review, a patron, aware of frequent falsehoods without strong defamation law, might calculate only a 38% chance of accuracy, potentially still within their acceptable risk level.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that with lax defamation laws (D0), consumers might still patronize negatively reviewed restaurants because reviews lack credibility. He then contrasts this with a "D1" world featuring strict defamation laws, where owners are presumed to sue over false negative reviews, though honest employees' behavior remains unchanged.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that defamation law, though not a perfect deterrent, can discourage some dishonest employees from falsely maligning high-quality restaurants, prompting truthful positive reviews due to lawsuit fears. However, highly motivated dishonest individuals, like very disgruntled employees, will likely continue defaming quality establishments despite legal risks.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that patrons, aware that some negative reviews might be false even with defamation law, may still view them as more significant signals of genuinely low quality. If the perceived probability of a negatively reviewed restaurant being bad (e.g., 55%) surpasses a patron's risk threshold (e.g., 40%), they will likely avoid it.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that expanding defamation law can paradoxically hurt high-quality providers because fewer false negative reviews lend more credibility to the remaining ones, causing patrons to avoid good businesses that are falsely disparaged. Conversely, weak defamation law leads to many false negatives, reducing overall review reliability, so patrons often disregard them and frequent high-quality establishments.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that stricter defamation laws, by reducing false statements, can paradoxically boost public trust in statements overall, making people more vulnerable to the heightened harm of any remaining falsehoods. This "seesaw dynamic" implies that fewer but more credible lies can lead to audiences being more easily deceived and acting upon false information due to increased general trust.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that stricter defamation law doesn't invariably protect reputation and can sometimes be detrimental, questioning the assumption of its unambiguous safeguarding role. His analysis concentrates on behavioral impacts on reputation, not overall social welfare, a broader issue involving multiple stakeholders and ex ante considerations.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that stricter defamation law may offer an unrecognized advantage by enhancing statement reliability, despite current worries about excessive trust in falsehoods. He suggests that significant audience effects can arise even if the public is unaware or mistaken about defamation law specifics, based merely on a general (possibly incorrect) belief that the law has been altered.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that defamation law reforms affect speaker behavior and also induce behavioral changes in the listening public, an aspect needing analysis. While audiences can be irrationally trusting, making falsehoods "sticky" via cognitive biases like anchoring, he believes it's improbable that falsehoods are so compelling as to negate audience perception and rationality entirely.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the "stickiness" of falsehoods—their resistance to refutation—dictates whether policy should prioritize reducing lie quantity or their credibility. He notes that flawed and expensive enforcement and litigation processes for falsehoods mean incentives to lie endure, as victims encounter substantial obstacles to obtaining redress.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that enhancing defamation lawsuit enforceability would reduce lie quantity but, due to audience effects and the "seesaw principle," paradoxically result in fewer yet more damaging falsehoods. He adds that social/moral norms against lying boost honest speaker numbers, elevating baseline statement credibility, and defamation law changes affect reliability relative to this baseline.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that while defamation law deters some falsehoods, it can paradoxically boost the credibility of those undeterred, potentially harming reputation. He also notes that a secondary aim of defamation law is victim redress, observing that current law frequently results in their under-compensation.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that justifying defamation law as redress for reputational harm is flawed because it overlooks how the law influences audience perception, thus contributing to the harm. He cites Elon Musk using Vernon Unsworth's lack of a lawsuit as supposed proof of guilt, illustrating how defamation law can be weaponized to harm, not protect, reputation.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that financial redress in defamation can worsen the harm it aims to fix, and its benefits must be evaluated considering audience effects. He also argues that vindicating reputation by disproving an allegation is flawed due to "circularity"—defamation law itself can create the need for vindication by making audiences believe initial falsehoods.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that the "vindication" rationale for defamation law is undermined by "entrenchment" (a court loss solidifying falsehoods) and "antivindication" (failure to sue implying guilt). These issues, plus "circularity," challenge the unambiguous justification of defamation law for reputation protection via vindication, requiring domain-specific analysis for such claims.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that defamation law is stricter in employment, where statements harming one's profession are actionable per se, offering exceptional protection. This heightened safeguard is vital because false claims from ex-employers can be ruinous, as risk-averse prospective employers might deny jobs even if an allegation has a low chance of being true.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that stricter defamation law, including per se protection for claims of crime or "loathsome disease," might be warranted to reduce false allegations where even a slight chance of truth is very harmful. He argues the case for such law is weaker in consumer markets, where "j-shaped" review distributions often see false negatives outnumbered by positives, and verifying claims from interactions poses judicial accuracy challenges.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that there should be a presumption against, or at least against broadening, defamation liability for consumer reviews, as high litigation costs could deter their creation as a public good. For political speech, despite "fake news" concerns, he argues defamation law should generally defer to free speech, partly because public awareness of such issues lessens some harm.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that typical constitutional analysis of defamation (free speech vs. reputation) is incomplete because stronger law might paradoxically harm reputation by fostering fewer, more credible lies versus more, less credible ones. He urges courts to weigh if fewer falsehoods justify the cost of remaining ones becoming more harmful and believable before expanding defamation law.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that judges tend to overestimate defamation law's benefits by looking at its gross impact on reputation, not its smaller net effect considering the "seesaw principle," potentially altering close case outcomes. Given constitutional free speech protection, he argues courts should favor it when uncertain about expanding defamation law, as the idea it inherently protects reputation is flawed and can be counterproductive.
    *   Professor Yonathan Arbel of the University of Alabama School of Law writes that stronger defamation laws might unintentionally make people more trusting of unverified statements, thus rendering remaining falsehoods more harmful. He hopes future scholarship will promote explicit consideration of audience effects in defamation jurisprudence, particularly regarding the law's relevance with anonymous online speech.
